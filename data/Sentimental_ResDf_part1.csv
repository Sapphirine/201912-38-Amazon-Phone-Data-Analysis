B00BV1MVJ0	2	"Attractive product, great interface, with a common major defect. \Right out of the box, the Galaxy S4 was a product with a great design, feel, and interface. The OS and features are very user-friendly and offer a great deal of customization if desired. Most of the nifty yet gimmicky features were simple to disable, leaving a smartphone with overall solid functionality and an overall solid price (given that it's now two generations old). Needless to say, I fell in love with the unlocked Galaxy S4 pretty quickly after receiving it in the mail. That is, until days later when I set up my mobile plan, popped in my SIM card, and learned that the device would not read it. With a quick Google search or two, it became increasingly evident to me that the S4 failing to read SIM cards is not just a very deep-seated issue (I think I saw 25 different solutions, none of which worked for me, as well as many others), but also a very common one for such a high-tier phone. This version was covered by a warranty (maybe U.S. only, not sure), but after reading stories of Samsung's half-baked \""\""solutions\""\"" to the issue (i.e. offering to replace the motherboard so the issue can resurface several months later)  I quickly decided to simply cut my losses and return the phone.

B00CQAOIIC	2	"Tried hard to like it, but... \I was waiting for this phone to come out at Verizon for a few months last year. Finally, it became available and I upgraded my Motorola Droid. At first, I really liked the quality of the screen, but soon my first impression was marred by the text messaging glitch when the users were not able to send text messages intermittently. Apparently, it was a result of a software update and complaints about it were widespread on the Internet. For me the issue lasted for a couple of days before MS/Nokia fixed it. Also, I found ridiculous that the phone didn't have the external New message or Missed call LED light. Another annoying thing was the signal strength. My Motorola phone (3G) never had reception problems where I work (western part of Los Angeles). Nokia phone often shows 1 bar LTE (4G) signal strength here, but is unable to make a call, send text message or connect to the web. Since the phone doesn't have a removable battery, there is a sequence of hardware keys to press for a hard restart. The first time the phone froze, I was getting into my car waiting for the important call and when the person actually called and I was not able to answer, I was ready to crush the phone. I suppose, freezing has also something to do with the software updates, because sometimes it occurs several times a day and sometimes not once in a couple of months (I don't have a lot of apps, so I can't attribute this freezes to the poorly programmed apps). Now, in order of priority: The quality of phone calls - no complaints. The sound is clear and loud. Bluetooth works just fine. The phone had glitches when the proximity sensor did not work properly and Mute, End call or other keys could be pressed on the screen inadvertently (this issue is well documented on the support web sites), but it seems to be a software problem and was fixed. What annoys me a lot, is that the volume key is not application-specific. For instance, if you want to watch a youtube clip without disturbing the others and turn the volume all the way down, it will mute your ringer and if you forget to turn it back up, it will stay muted. The same is true for the phone's music player. Web browsing. I do a lot of browsing on my phones. The standard issue Internet Explorer (IE) is beyond pathetic. When I got the phone, there were no other browsers available. These days a few more can be downloaded, but Firefox is still not available. I tried Nokia browser and did not like it. IE is slow, freezes more often that I can tolerate, cannot handle some web pages, does not have Forward capability (sometimes very inconvenient). E-mail. No major issues here. All my corporate accounts and a hotmail account it integrated seamlessly. The issue with Hotmail (a Microsoft service, supposed to work perfectly with the MS software environment), however, is that Trash and Junk folders don't seem to sync properly, despite \""\""Sync all folders\""\"" setting is selected. I noticed it after few months and it resulted in that the phone stores a couple of hundreds of sent messages and almost a thousand of spam messages that only can be deleted by checking them ONE BY ONE - there is no way to select all of them at once. And yes  I delete these every couple of days when I log on to my account from my computer. Messaging. I don't do a lot of messaging;"""	-0.2	18.7

I have a nano-sim to micro-sim adapter on order, hopefully coming in later this week so I can go back to using the S2... Nice phone, great features, AMAZING hardware spec (I buy phones based on their performance, and this takes the cake over the 5s)... BUT the android software feels like it was a rush release for this product... Here's what I don't like: I use the password lock-screen featuer -> worked great on the S2 since it had a keyboard designed just for the lock screen... But this one uses the same pop-up keyboard that it has while texting or anything else... the way it's designed to pop up into focus let's me see my homescreen wallpaper through my lock-screen wallpaper -_-' ... OH well, I can live with that I guess. The keyboard sucks... I would of have thought that having a bigger screen meant the keys would be scaled up...

Try unlocking your phone during rush hour traffic on a 5-lane highway doing 75... you may just get a new perspective here... I got an Otterbox Defender case for the S4. Disappointed that the new cases aren't as thick for the S4 as they are for my S2, but that's otterbox, not me.

The phone is the Pixel 2 which is cheaper than the latest model. I've heard some great reviews about the Google phone but I'm not too impressed. ISSUES: 1. The phone stops video streaming when attached or detached from charger. You'll have too go completely out of the streaming video and back into it again. Not convenient. 2. When watching Youtube videos, you'll have to manually 'x' out of the control feature every single time, for every single video. The controls won't simply disappear like Xfinity go or Amazon videos. 3. \""\""Ok Google\""\"" option is less reliable on the Google phone than Samsung. How's that possible that the Google features and entertainment platforms work horribly on a Google phone than any other Android products? Final: I've given up on Samsung becaise of the subpar and rather suspicious customer service experience in 2018. I won't invest in a Apple phone due to it's closed market. The Andriod Market is the best in comparison. When it comes to the Google phone  the only bright side is thw battery life and picture ond picture taking qualities. That's not enough to keep me from moving on to other Andriod based phones outside of the aforementioned and perhaps taking a chance on an LG phone in the future.

B01HU2C224	3	"Weak Reception \The GS 7 is a wonderful phone, and this review is not about the phone model itself. I do not criticize the seller either because I received prompt refund approval over the defective model I received. A small issue about the sale is that I received the black model instead of the gold, for which I had paid an extra $5. A second issue, not serious, was that the model I received was a SM-G930U instead of a SM-G930V, which was listed in the title. This seemed to complicate activating the phone, but eventually it was done. It turned out that the reception on this particular specimen evidently was too weak to support voice calling or LTE data, whereas on my other GS 7 I get about 3 bars. This lead to a long troubleshooting process and a lot of dialog with Verizon. The thing that fooled me and Verizon is that they were able to push through a text message (given some time) used to test the connection. The prelude to activation is fairly lengthy -- transfer of contacts, apps, etc. plus SW updates. Regrettably the issue of reception and setup cost me about half a day.

The notifications and people functions are cool, but totally unnecessary. The fingerprint scanner was easy to set up to work with multiple fingers (up to 4) and works very well. The backup password is more secure than a typical 4 digit code (had to be at least 8(?) characters),though I haven't had any problems opening the phone with my fingerprint. The heart rate monitor is really cool. I've been checking it at various times of the day and it's cool to see how low (or high!) your heart rate is. Overall, the response to using apps and web pages is fast. It loads webpages really quickly, email was easy to set up and my gmail and hotmail accounts are easy to access from the same icon and I can switch between them with a simple swipe. My work email loads quickly and works as expected as well. The way the email system is set up, it allows you to swipe right or left to get to the next or previous message which I've found rather convenient. So far, the battery is great! I've been warned against \""\""over charging\""\"" so I never leave it charging overnight  as I did my previous phone. The fast charging is really super-fast.

The seller's name was SELLER PRO 55, if I am remembering correctly, and this seller has high positive views. I am asuming that a lot of the fake products and broken/wrong items that arrived for other customers were from other sellers, so be sure to check where your phone is coming from. This product was almost exactly how I expected it to be. The only bad thing about this phone is that i cannot seem to connect the S Pen as a remote. The pen works beautifully on the screen as a drawing tool, writing tool, and even for the live messages. However, I've been trying to connect it as a remote, only to come up failing every time. At this point, I'm not sure if it is an error on my part or the manufacturers. I have googled videos on how to reconnect it, yet cannot figure it out. However, until i figure it out, I've turned the remote feature off, and use it as a regular S Pen on screen. I've used apple products as well as androids/samsung devices, and I always find myself favoring Samsung products by a large margin. Starting off using an older Samsung phone makes this upgrade even more drastic, but it hasn't affected my opinion as much as I thought it would. This phone has to be my favorite phone on the market currently by a large margin. A lot of people mention the Bixby feature being quite annoying to have, however I barely use it. The Bixby button is on the left side of the phone, and I have made it so that i have to press and hold the Bixby button in order for it to work, so it does not give me much trouble at all. The Bixby feature when you swipe left on the home screen does not bother me much at all either. I have made it so very few notifications show up there, so I rarely have to open it. The edge features are so useful as well. I made it so my most used contacts show up when I pull open the edge screen, and it makes quick contact with my mom or sister so much easier.

B07FZHHQB8	4	"First actual smartphone, last place never. \I got this phone a few months ago as well as an s10e (new) a month later. This being refurbished was a worthy purchase. The battery life is decent, the display is amazing, and there is nothing this phone has an issue doing. The s-pen feature is something you need to seriously consider as if you dont find much use for it, you might as well get a different phone. Over time, the pen lost a bit if value with the updates to the UI as most things can be done without it. If there was only one thing I wish this phone had, it is a wide angled lens for the rear cameras. There is one on the front for selfies, but it is actually limited to taking 3:4 images. Aside from that, the photos are outstanding and the video cameras on the rear are good enough to run a YouTube channel on - in the light. The fingerprint sensor is great and is the fastest way to unlock the phone. Face unlock is almost as quick and iris sensors would be the slowest, and it works well. As for the condition of my unit, there were a few problems. First thing I noticed was that the earbuds were seemingly shot. The s10e I received later came with the same earbuds but they sounded great. The ones with the Note9 were completely void of bass, and it might just have been me, but the ear inserts were uncomfortable. The glass back on this phone has a small blemish over the flashlight, but functionally, it wasn't invasive. Lastly, the front of the phone at a glance looked flawless until I found a blemish on the top right corner of the screen that could only be seen under sunlight when the screen is off. Not a big deal, but I might not be too confident in this phone's ability to resist water. This phone also has been printed on the back to say \""\""Refurbished by Asurion\""\"" which from what I understand is a Samsung approved company to refurbish their phones. A solid purchases and if you are wondering how this compares with the newly released Note10  this phone is still a beast and still benefits from having a headphone jack and a micro SD card slot (the higher level of the Note10 has this option). The Note10 also does not have any sort of facial unlock feature. That phone isnt breaking any ground and it is more refined but isnt so great that the Note9 is obsolete.

B07MN8QTK1	4	"Good size for me \I based my new phone search upon the phone being 72 mm or less wide. The phone had to be under $200. I need a phone that is easy to hold and operate in my right hand. Phones are right handed for those that are not left handed and forced to figure this out immediately. When my phone arrived it was not champagne colored. The Liberace in me was truly disappointed. Though the blue sparkle in the black back appeased me. YES I was shipped the wrong phone in the correct box. But since it was still a 72mm wide MotoG7 Play, I was all good. For $135 it is a lot of phone for the money. Especially since the black one was $140.. for some reason. I know I could have gotten a beat up used Pixel One for about the same price. (SARCASM) Which also fits my size criteria. The Android experience is pretty much the same. But I have the added \""\""Moto Actions\""\"" to accidentally turn on my camera or flashlight.

So I can minimize the recharge cycles. So my battery will not be burned out prematurely. I find the camera is really good for a phone. I have a digital camera with a tripod if I need to take better photos with more light setting options. Like capturing lights at night and so forth. I do not use a fingerprint reader  would rather not have my biometrics stored on my phone. But I read that it does work good for those that use it.

Windows 8 on a phone is really nice. It is very simple to use and highly functional. Also the black and white theme is really my style which is good because the phone has very limited theme options so keep that in mind. Win8 does have some downsides though: The browser and bing search freaking suck. Even if you change your default search to something else the search button still pulls up bing. Seriously stop shoving that down our throats. Luckily there is an app called \""\""UC Broswer\""\"" and that will greatly improve your internet browsing experience. Other failures include the app market which has very little content right now. I can't even do my banking online with this phone... although perhaps that is my bank's fault for not making the app but plenty of apps are missing from this market. I also didn't see any theme apps or apps to change the tile page itself although there were plenty of tile changing apps. That is the last thing that bugged me was the tile page didn't fit the theme at all and the theme options wouldn't let me change it and no apps existed that would change it.

You won't regret it. \Quick reference review: (details below) Fantastic all around! beautifully crisp screen in full HD, very quick response time for all around performance from texts to apps to games. Battery life is astounding, average users will have no problem going throughout a day on one battery, or even two. Connection on Verizon is fast, for both Data and Calls. I haven't experience any call quality issues. Camera qualities are second to none. The S-pen is a nice feature to have. Phone layout/buttons is easy to get used too. I can use this phone easily with one hand, but I have big hands in general. If your only issue with this phone is its size, GET IT. You easily get used to the size and don't even notice it (however i wouldnt recommend to individuals with tiny hands). Comment with any other questions ill try to get back as quick as I can. Bought this phone off amazon in january (2 months ago) due to its amazing deal and reduced price and I am not at all dissatisfied. Worth noting, I purchased this phone over the LG G2. I do have a single significant complaint on this phone regarding the charger, scroll to the bottom for that. Design: The layout and physical features of this phone are fantastic. While it may not be encased in a solid block of metal, you never feel like your holding a cheap phone. The materials are very sturdy and well made, especially when one utilizes a case. In my opinion, being able to access the battery, sim, microSD in the back of the phone is more useful than it being in a solid metal body. The phone itself is incredibly thin. I purchased a Spigen slim hardcase for the phone because I wanted to keep the phone sleek and thin as designed. Button placement is very intuitive and easy to get used too. Hardware: This phone is fast. All the benchmark tests do not lie. This thing performs better than any phone i've had and is faster than my 1st gen Samsung Galaxy Tab. I like to get the most out of my phones, to the point of unlocking them, but even with all of the pre-loaded bloat-apps this thing still flys. Great on WiFi or LTE. Screen is amazingly clear, with great contrast and color. Buttons are firm and don't feel like they're going to break. The speakers are good, not great. They get the job done for most users watching youtube or listening to music occasionally. If you're a hardcore music lover and sound quality is a top priority, you may want to look elsewhere. Touch screen sensitivity is great out of the box. I've had no issues. UI and software: If you've ever used an andriod or samsung device before, you'll quickly find yourself comfortable with this phone. If you've never used it before, it is easy and very enjoyable. I always recommend it over iOS, But I don't have enough experience with Windows to sway you from it. But the User Interface is intuitive and for the most part can be understood by most. There are so many customization's. From different widgets, layouts, screens, you have so many options to satisfy the most eclectic or OCD personalities. Camera: So many phones have crazy camera features or settings, while the average user wont notice or use half of them. I will say, the picture quality and useful features on this phone can be handy. From action shots to selfies to posting your lunch to instragram this phone with suffice for most! I always say if you want to really take meaningful pictures, buy a DSLR! Size: The size of this phone always seems to be the sticky issue with people. As I mentioned before, if size is the only issue holding you back from this phone, JUST GET IT. 99% of your wont be disappointed, and will quickly get used to the phone. Depending on your size, it will be easier than others. The average male wouldn't have a problem with it in his pocket. For reference I am about 6 foot and average build with larger hands. I'm always amazed how often I don't even feel it. However, for smaller individuals it may be an issue. My honest opinion is find one in person. I went to BestBuy and the Samsung rep allowed me to hold his work Note3. I was able to get a real sense of size and feel of it in my pocket, and not just attached to a display table. I love having a larger screen, it just makes it that much easier to use and enjoy, and to me outweighs any size inconvenience. Battery Life: It's amazing. The big size means samsung is able to throw a big battery in it. So even though the larger screen uses more power, many average users wont have a problem going an entire day on one charge. on average i get about a day and a half. If i use heavy (constant screen on) for several hours straight, then i'll run the battery down in a day. But idle in your pocket with LTE on all day. You'll have no issues. The USB 3.0 charger/port is fantastic. This thing charges so fast. I can get a full charge in half the time as my old HTC Thunderbolt. People complain about the thickness of the cord, but its required for the phone to charge that fast, safely. Which brings me to my only issue i've had with this phone... My only complaint: I had a few issues charging my phone. At first I was extremely upset as I thought the port inside my phone was defective. Essentially, with the USB 3.0 cord and charger, you get 2 connections in one. The standard USB port, and an extra smaller port which is why your able to achieve such fast charging and data transfers. My issue was that one of the 2 connections on the USB3 wasn't getting a solid contact in my phone. This lead to longer charge times and my phone telling me \""\""Please use the original charger that came with your phone for faster charging\""\"". I simply bought a new cord on amazon and i haven't had any problems since. I recommend to anyone having charging issues to first try another cord  as my issue was that the connection to the phone on the cord;"""	0.3	43.3

Transferred over my Tracfone number to here easily, and everything has been perfect since I got it a few days ago. I have been buying a new phone at least once a year, never satisfied by either size, or carrier, or whatever. Now I am very happy. My one ding is that the company that sold it, Kanga, did not include a USB-C to a USB-A. Instead, it was USB-C on both ends, which is useless for all but the latest computers owing to lack of USB-C. Fortunately, being a computer geek, I had such a needed cable I borrowed from another phone. Plus, I had just ordered the kind of cable needed, and it came the next day. So, I did not ding the review down to 4 stars as I had originally planned. Furthermore, Kanga had immediately offered me a refund with prepaid return envelope. That impressed me, but knowing that and the fact that I was getting the proper cable anyway, I did not lower the score. The only other slight ding is the screen seems a bit greasy, so I have to apply a bit of solution and a cloth, I guess. But, very trivial point, especially when I see the amazing speed of downloading one app after the other, each seconds apart, and the Pixel does not slow down, even when downloading a dozen or more apps simultaneously. With 128 GB storage and 4 GB RAM, it is amazing. Best phone I've ever owned, and I love the size as well (5\""\"" screen). Oh... there is also no sim card removal tool  but that is okay.

The charger they include in the box is a standard Samsung Adaptive Fast Charger with a 3m USB-c to USB-a cord. It charges VERY slowly. I think this is due to the high capacity of the battery and the wattage of the charger. Anyway, I would strongly suggest that you factor in the cost of a Google brand phone charger. Best buy sells them for 39.99. (Amazon's listed one's are not actually Google branded and per the reviews it does matter). The shipping does require a signature (woot woot)' so plan for that.

Once I realized the mistake it had shipped so I figured I'd give it a try, and I'm glad I did. It still fits in most shirt pockets and really isn't more of a problem than my previous Samsung S5 (yeah, I was overdue for an upgrade.) The Pixel XL has a great camera. I have very shaky hands (essential tremor) and had a very difficult time taking photos with the Samsung. The Pixel has auto stabilization and it makes a world of difference. It also takes great pictures in low light (and I believe there are hacks to make it work even better, or upcoming upgrades.) The speaker and mic are a big improvement over the Samsung. With the Samsung, on calls using speaker mode, it would block out the mic whenever someone at the other end was speaking. Not a problem with the Pixel. The speaker still isn't quite as good as my wife's iPhone (5S, I think; maybe 6S.) Phone reception is now at least as good as my wife's iPhone, where the Samsung was definitely inferior.

It lost the data signal a few times shortly after I got the phone, but that may have been, in part, because I was in a dead zone.

It was decided that a loss in performance was preferable to being raked over the coals. After researching mid-market phones I decided on the Nokia 7.1. Upon receiving the phone I installed an AT&T SIM Card and updated the phone. Downloaded a few of apps and set it up to my liking. Then I began using it to see why it was ~$500 less than a Galaxy or iPhone. I haven't find the reason why yet. Instead I keep being pleasantly surprised by how fast it is and the neat new features it has.

But what is noticeable is the quality of the camera or should I say the lack of. If whatever you're trying to take a picture of make sure it's still. The performance is by far one of the best values in mobile. I'm a bit tech savvy so I can strain a device pretty fast with all the stuff I'm doing with it such as, gaming (every game I tried runs smooth), running different launchers, constantly checking my social media, etc. But without any hiccups. By the end of the day I'll still well above the 40% mark. The charge times are phenomenal getting a full charge around 1.5 hours. Not bad if I should say so. I'm not surprised but it would've been a lot nicer to have nfc but it's no deal breaker. The speaker at the bottom of the phone to the right of the charging port is what you'd expect from a phone at this price range. Now with one more issue, I'm worried that my sim might stop working, I'm running on metro for those who want to know. The reason of this being I've seen reviews where their phone stopped accepting their sims and my phone after a reboot shows a message (sometimes) like \""\""sim card not found\""\"" but it's usually no problem because it works still. Lastly the phone is pretty sturdy after the first drop which wasnt a very big drop  was the only one to cause significant damage.

Do note: It only comes with the phone & pen, a charging cord, charging block, and sim tool. Not the headphones, pen tips or other accessories that are bundled with a new phone. If you need those items, you may be just as well to buy new. If not, save yourself some money. I use T-Mobile. The phone recognized my SIM card and registered on the network instantly. I did not have to go through any extra hoops to connect to LTE+ or use my WiFi calling. I didn't even have to contact customer service to make sure the phone was properly recognized. Phew! The Android Pie update just got pushed to the Note 9 and it makes the phone feel even slicker. As for the phone: I am blown away by the battery life and UI improvements over my previous Note 5. I am not a heavy gamer but I do put a lot of strain on the phone with research, camera use, and design programs. The phone is large for my small hands, but there are a lot of ways to control the phone with one hand and voice. I am smitten with the remote control pen.

I was about to look in my phone to possibly do the updates as others have said they done, but my phone would not turn on. I am flabbergasted as I've barely used the phone. I can't recommend this phone. When I got to use it, it worked fine in it's basic of basic ways. The OS was definitely lacking but it's simplicity was beautiful. Unfortunately there is something wrong with the hardware on this device for it not to turn on. I tried charging it. I tried pulling the battery, nothing has worked.

International Omnia W model. No 4G only 3G, cannot register with Samsung therefore no warranty. I would not recommend this product for purchase in the US. Choose another supplier, I will be returning this product as it is not as advertised. However I already own one of these phones and I love it, best phone I ever bought so do not be afraid of the product, quality and durability are the top of the line, just make sure you are getting a US version product. Just a follow up, if you look at the pictures with the product that is what you should be getting. That is a US version phone, international version does not have a USB cable to connect to computer and charger, only a charger, there are tremendous differences between these two versions, do not let anyone tell you otherwise. Further update on this product. I have contacted all 3 of the Amazon third party sellers that they provide fulfillment for on this product. None of them can guarantee that you will receive actual Focus Flash. Until Amazon makes these sellers comply with an accurate product detail and it matches what it states in the item description I highly recommend you do not purchase if inside of the US, you will more than likely not receive a Focus Flash but rather its international version called Omnia W. Please save yourself the headaches I just went through. I purchased mine elsewhere for less money and it is an AT&T branded phone which is fine by me.

B007X6FFLS	1	Don't Be A Samsung Sucker I've owned so many cell phones over the decades. Motorola Sony Nokia Pantec Apple and this my first Samsung. What a waste of my time and money. It's cheap granted which is why I bought it but no matter how cheap it has to actually work which two of these did not. Just glad Amazin makes returns easy because they both went back as these phones are not worth even fifteen bucks. They both dropped calls repeatedly. They both missed calls repeatedly. They both had wimpy and weird sounds for ring tones. Suppose it's a good thing to not hear the phone when it did ring as the different tones to choose from in the phone were so weird sounding and none of the choices were anything resembling what you'd associate with a phone ringing. The build was creaky flimsy plasticky and LCD screens were washed out dimly lit hard to see in low light and impossible to read in sunlight.

After using for a few years, started randomly force-quitting programs, terminating the phone connection and even completely shutting down with a full battery. Tried to get support & repairs and informed that the device was EOL and nothing can be done, short of complete replacement. Do not buy unless you have been trained as a Motorola technician or don't mind completely replacing your hardware if anything goes wrong. Our software only supports MC 55 and MC 75 units, but due to the questionable reliability of these units, I am also questioning the MC 55's life cycle and whether this will happen again.

It froze up with a black screen, Like many times before I did a soft reset, by holding down the volume down button & the power button. It was resetting like normal until it got to the droid eye. It has been stuck there since. I even attempted a factory reset by holding the volume up button & power button, then after the droid shows up, by holding both volume buttons. still to no avail. If you want an inferior product that will fall apart in no time free wire mobile is the place to go. 1;	-0.2	5.6

B0096QYH80	1	Dont recomend unless you like bricks. Got the phone as a spare and when It came time to using it I got a SIM card and tried to active it. Verizon said it must be a bad SIM card and sent me another one. After that one didn't work they said the phone was probably rooted and wouldn't work. Three Verizon stores later I kept getting told the same thing and finally had to buy a new phone from there. So now I'm stuck with a brick that lights up and tells me it needs a SIM card. 1;	-0.2	2.3

B00B2BYU1Q	1	I was ripped off I had no idea I could have written to your company until a few days ago. I purchased a phone from your company through amazon. The order was placed on November 4th 2013. I ordered a Nokia Lumia 920 and your company sent me a Nokia Lumia 900 instead. The phone does not ring or make any sound. All settings and volumes are where it is too be and yet no sound. I am highly disappointed in the deception of your company and will never do any business with you or recommend your company to anyone. I am also disappointed in Amazon for allowing your company to rip off good people of their hard earned money for inferior goods and incorrect goods. 1;	-0.4	3.8

Also the charger you have given is in white colour ..where as my phone is black 4. Phone is getting heatedup and the battery wears out so soon. Product you sent is not at all in par with the product you sent. Even a used phone will be better than the one (NEW) you sent me. I quite unhappy with this.

I kept it in mint condition, rarely ever took it with me on excursions to protect it. Kept it in a case with a screen shield. Seller said they would not assist me. If you want to pay $400 for a disposable phone, this may work for you!! Beware, look elsewhere if you can, don't let this happen to you in a few months. This seller will send you a gray market phone meant for another country /market, they no doubt got on the black market, and will not stand behind it after their 30 day contractual obligation.

B00B2BYU1Q	1	I've only had the phone for less than a month ... I've only had the phone for less than a month when it suddenly died on me. I tried charging it, turning it on/off, pressing different buttons, etc but nothing happened. I left it charging for a couple of hours (though, the phone was charge before it died) and nothing happened. I tried moving and twisting the charger and all of sudden when I plugged/unplug the charger from the phone itself, it started charging. So my assumption was, the charging connector is either loose or damaged. Since this was thru a 3rd party vendor, it was hard to get a replacement phone right away. I had to basically return the phone, order a new one and then get my refund. I talked to an Amazon rep who didn't give me any options but to process the return and that was it. Somehow, I got disconnected from that rep and I called back. Thankfully, the 2nd rep was kind enough to offer me a free expedited shipping so I was able to get a replacement phone in 2 days. It was so inconvenient to not have a phone that I mainly use for home and work. For a less than a month old phone, it should have lasted longer than my original Nokia Lumia (2 years). 1;	-0.3	6.0
B00B2BYU1Q	1	Phone stopped working in just 2 months with Software & Hardware problems. Bought my Nokia Lumia 920 on Oct 15 2013. It was working fine for the first 2 months. Occasionally there would be signal coverage problems but I thought it was something to do with the Network provider. But then after 2 months, I started experiencing major problems with the phone. The display would flicker & the display got all grainy. Network signal coverage started getting hit badly. There was no physical damage to the phone, meaning the phone was NOT dropped in ground or water or any liquid for that matter. One fine day, it was totally gone. It wouldn't simply start. On taking it to a Nokia customer care center, It was informed that this was a manufacturer defect and it was something to do with its hardware & software. Poooofff... I thought there goes my $350 :( But fortunately I contacted Amazon after 3 months of purchase and explained them the problems. They were kind enough to listen to my problems and accepted a return after the warranty & gave me a refund. Here is my Verdict: For Nokia Lumia 920: Pros: 1. Photo quality is good. 2. Speaker volume is good. 3. Sturdy build Cons: 1. Very Unstable Hardware & Software with Windows OS. 2. Lot of problems/bug with the phone. 3. Quite Heavy P.S: Amazon Customer service was 10/10 as usual & they saved me $350. Thank you! 1;	-0.1	10.2

B00B6SFDHK	1	Beware Demo phone! The phone delivered was a demo phone with firmware/software installed to use as a showroom demo. I could not activate with Verizon by myself as it would not give me access to the keyboard. The local Verizon store activated the phone after removing the SIM card and recording the serial number. Once activated, the phone would continually reload demo software (VZW demo and installer) and then run a continuous demo. I tried to uninstall the relevant apps but they appear to be firmware. A reset did not help. Other users have reported that the only way to defeat the demo is to root (jailbreak) the device. In addition to the intolerable demo, the phone would not charge beyond 30% nor would it allow Google search. New phone, good price, but not for anyone who does not intend to jailbreak the phone.

The battery drains so much faster than the original new one I got from Verizon, it is SUBSTANTIALLY slower than my original one (I don't even bother with google navigation because it can't keep up with normal driving speed and has either gotten me lost or almost in an accident every time I've tried it), it freezes in many different programs, the screen just shuts off on occasion, and probably about HALF the texts I send don't go through (I don't even want to know how many incoming texts I've not gotten because of this phone).

B00CIF9MJK	1	Don't buy this phone. If 0 stars was an option, that's what I'd give it. I should have given up on it sooner, is all I can say... I went through 4 different phone companies trying to get this phone to work, and no matter how many different coverage options or SIM cards were tried, the phone refused to work. Biggest waste of time and money ever, and by the time I finally got through to a tech support agent who was able to figure out WHY it would never work (coded for use with Asian systems and not compatible with US networks or something to that effect), it was too late to return the stinking thing. So I spent all that money on a phone that never worked, not to mention nearly another $300 in phone plans that I never got anything out of. If you want my advice, buy your phone at the store.

B00E92B88I	1	NOT READY FOR PRIME-TIME OR GROWNUPS NOT FIT FOR BUSINESS USE - OR ADULTS, EITHER! The Moto X is an AWFUL DISAPPOINTMENT for an upper-tier smartphone... Here's why: Google-owned Motorola just can't seem to get it right with the Moto X. The battery life is sub-standard; the camera function and photo quality were acceptable BEFORE the latest Google-forced Android update, Kit-Kat 4.4.3, but unusable after. The 4.4.3 update also ruined the dialer function with an ugly and dysfunctional replacement and revised the graphical user interface to look like more like a kindergarten toy or Windows-type, Tile-based phone - UGLY, STUPID and CHILDISH!!! Because Google forces the updates on you with no way to go back to the system that came with the phone, I returned both of them for a refund. 1;	-0.5	3.9

You can't even buy another battery and swap it out. I shut off the location to make it more of a \""\""dumb phone\""\"" but that didn't even seem to help much. I think I will be returning it.

B00I3OIXJU	1	junk, Junk, JUNK OK, bought this for my son for Christmas. We have Nokia 635s (through Target)on the BrightSpot plan, and they have been well worth the money. This one arrived just fine, and set up ok (except that some of the words are in eastern syllabics rather than in the English alphabet). But soon, it started having troubles. At first, it took 3 or 4 tries to download updates but they did download. Now they won't install, and take forever to even get them queue'd up. No, he has barely used the camera, and has nothing much saved on it, so it isn't a matter of memory. For the first weeks, he used it a bit to make calls and text; and at that point it worked fairly well. Now, he cannot place calls (when I call him it goes straight to voicemail) and texts don't go through either way. Over all, very disappointed in this item.

I'm on my second Samsung battery and the battery life on these phones is dismal. Otherwise it's a great phone. It's a little bulky compared to some of the sleeker phones that cost four times as much, but I wouldn't buy it again. ONE YEAR UPDATE: My battery now doesn't last two hours, so I carry around a battery backup with it. I've been a cell phone user for 20 years and this phone, hands down, has the worst battery life.

We also have a S6 and 7 but like the 5 best. However this one at 1 month started to act up. When you attempt to bring the screen on half of the time you can hear the audio tones but no screen. You either have to pull the battery or just make repeated attempts to find the screen. When you have an incoming call, half of the time same screen issue with no way to answer. When the screen does work properly during a call at the end when you hang up the phone goes into a shutdown sequence for no reason. Other S5's have no issue work good, last a long time.

B00LAEA8E8	1	It Was a Lemon After needing a new phone and realizing how expensive everything has become, it seemed clear to me to explore the refurbished industry. When the phone first arrived, I had zero complaints. It came in its original box, had all the normal accessories, and worked flawlessly. After a month though, it stopped reading the SIM card. I tried all the tricks that I could research, and finally just brought the phone into the Verizon store.

B00LYRY2AM	1	Totally disappointed! I ordered this phone as a gift which is supposed to be a new phone instead i received a refurbished one! The package came from amazon return center, there is no longer a seal on the nokia box so i called the customer service (which i find a great thing about amazon) and they send a replacement one right away. I just recieved the replacement phone but sadly it is even worse from the first one i got! It even has scratches and it also came from the return center and the box has no seal as well.

B00NMWYA36	1	SMH! POS! This is the second one I got from same seller. I love galaxy phones but these were garbage. The first one had a battery that was so hot when it charged that it literally hurt your hand and then would drain in a very short time and once it hit 30% would just shut off. Also when we took the plastic cover off of the camera part, the glass that covers the camera came off!! I have never even seen something like that! So I sent it back. Thought it was just bad luck. Ordered another from same seller. ThE next one charged great and I thought I was in the clear. Nope! When someone called me they could not hear me speak at all.

B00NMWYA36	1	"Don't buy in 2017 \This phone was old when I got it in 2016 but usable but the recent updates to all the apps have rendered it slow and almost useless in 2017. The unit I received also had screen burn in which is common for amoled screens but was mentioned nowhere in the listing. Seller did give $75 back though which was nice. The camera is great during the day but a nightmare during the night or in low light. It looks like a old laptop webcam from like 2005. The front camera is terrible as well dosnt work at all during low light and selfies turn out muddy and noisy. If your looking for a phone with a good camera look elsewhere. Also if you want a battery that lasts through the day look elsewhere I was lucky to get 2 hrs of screen on time with this phone and when used for long periods of time it got very hot and slowed down to nothing which got very frustrating after a while. My old nexus 4 was actually faster then it most of the time. Another issue with this phone is the buttons, they trigger so easily in your pocket that you constantly pocket dial people or accidentally delete apps, the phone almost called 911 without me even knowing it. This is also bad for battery life as your screen is constantly on in your pocket. The \""\""ruggedness\""\"" of this phone is over-hyped as well the corners provide some extra protection against drops but the screen is easily crack-able and about $300 to replace  also this phone is NOT waterproof just mildly water resistant don't trust it swimming or under water at all I find it stupid that the waterproofing is supposed to be a main feature of this phone but almost every time it fails. Another thing to note is when the screen is wet it becomes completely unusable you can't type or touch apps as the whole thing just glitches from one tiny drop of water or sweat on it. Pretty much the only things that I liked about this phone were the map-able active key and the loudspeaker. Everything else just seems to fall short. I had this phone for a year;"""	-0.4	9.3

T-Mobile offers a one year warranty, but you have to send the phone back, wait for a replacement, and go without a phone for the interim period. The charger broke after only 6 weeks, and after 6 months you had to insert a piece of paper between to help the battery maintain contact.

B00ZE8HRYK	1	It seems to be in good shape. We just received it Update - I gave the phone to my daughter as a gift on Christmas. We took it to AT&T and bought a SIM card. The phone does not accept SIM cards. It is defective. I am now in the process of returning the phone and buying her another form somewhere else. It seems to be in good shape. We just received it. It was fully charged and ready to go. It does have a couple of small scratches on the case (4), some are deep (on the corners), but it is refurbished. I bought a case cover for it and you cannot see the scratches. The screen is in great shape no scratches. It does not have a cover for the charger plug in area, I do not know if that is standard on the S6 actives? I still have to find that out or if that will make a difference on this design as far as water proofing. But as a whole, the phone appears to be in good working shape (apps, camera,etc). It has signal and we will really test it when it as given a present soon. 1;	0.0	7.2

B00ZE8HRYK	1	NOT RUGGED. If that is your reason for considering this phone, heads up. I've only had this for about three months. It started to run really slow after only two months of use and the screen shattered after it just slowly slid off a small bag that was sitting on the floor. I am shocked this phone is advertised as rugged after that experience. This was a total waste of money and I won't be buying another samsung active. I had an s5 before which had a similar issue and decided to give this brand another chance thinking maybe the newer edition would be improved. 1;	-0.1	2.6
B00ZE8HRYK	1	Unhappy with seller UPDATE: I actually do still like the phone.. at least the Samsung brand and version. However, I don't believe this phone was new when I purchased it. Soon after I received it I got a notification on the phone that there was an update available. I followed the prompts and after several minutes saw a notification that the update had failed to install. It was a quick little message at the bottom of the screen and I did think it was odd that an update wouldn't install but decided that maybe I had done something to interrupt it and forgot about it. (It still will not install a system update) I started having problems next with the stability of the Bluetooth. It will not stay on consistently - comes on and goes off at random (which explains why it wouldn't stay connected to the Sync in my car from the beginning as well) I discovered this when I purchased a Bluetooth earbud that tells you when power is on/off and when devices connects and when device disconnects. It was telling me over and over that the devices was connecting and then disconnecting... and then connecting and then disconnecting. I started researching and talking to technicians to see if there was something I could do to fix it, but all of those suggestions failed. Then last weekend I drove an hour and a half away to the closest Samsung Experience Shop to my home, and the Samsung employee connected it to his computer to attempt to Reflash the phone. Unfortunately, he was unable to fix it that way either and told me that there is a hardware issue that is not allowing it to update and the Bluetooth issue is likely a defective antenna. My options are to try to get a refund/exchange or send it in to Samsung to be fixed. After all of the research I have done and the things I have discovered with this phone ... numbers that don't match and the fact that it hasn't been able to install system updates AND THEN finding out that because it's from a 3rd party seller, it only had a 3 month warranty instead of the standard 1 year warranty ... I find it hard to believe that this was a NEW phone when I purchased it. The seller insists that it was new and that there isn't anything they can do. I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews! 1;	-0.3	9.0

B010V43VFA	1	Don't buy this, the overheating really makes it unsuable Pros: * it looks really nice. I have received many complements for this phone from people (at least to me) * it feels very nice and it is pretty sturdy! I have dropped it many times but it still works and the screen is not shattered. Cons: * Don't buy this phone. The overheating issue is not something you can look over. It makes the phone literally unusable. Overheating causes this phone to slow down significantly to the point you want to scream. Any app that uses the CPU intensively slows down the phone. I will list the top apps that you practically can't use: 1- Camera: YOU CANNOT USE THE CAMERA more than a minute or so. It becomes very unfortunate when you are recording a rare event (let's say a concert and your camera app shuts down because the phone is overheated. You cannot trust the camera for being quick and responsive either when your phone is hot. It takes a while to load and start working. 2- Maps (navigation): navigation is a CPU heavy process. That means it no camera or any other feature of your phone while that's happening. To be fair, you can make calls but the phone works so slow that it really goes on your nerves! 3- Snapchat: Snapchat is impossible to use on this phone. even if the phone is perfectly idle, Snapchat kills your phone. It makes your phone extremely hot in in tens of seconds and becomes unresponsive until. It's not to say you can't use it at all, it's just you have wait and be patient when you are using it. so if something is happening and you want to send a quick snap of that moment, you should forget about that! Even worse, if you connect your phone to a charger and open Snapchat your phone gets hot in no time and although the charger is still connected you battery percentage keeps slowly going down. 4- Skype: it's like Snapchat but a little better. You can't really use skype and multi-task. Skype alone is very heavy on the phone. 1;	-0.3	14.5

Opened it up and the touch screen didn’t register for turning it off. Had to restart it as the screen didn’t work at all. Should have put it in the box right away, the phone was already set up, I didn’t get the white screen with Hello, like you normally do. And I got an after market charger. I paid 200.00 for a late model. I think this company should get apple certified chargers. It’s customer quality for a little more money. It was kinda cool that the company had their own logo on the case and charger, but it was short lived. I’ve had it for about a week and it is freezing, shutting down my apps as I am using them. I have to turn it off and turn it on repeatedly through the day to be able to use the phone. Last night I was on the phone and it wouldn’t let me be on the phone.

The first phone won't charge or even turn on because it can't be charged. Not any visible damage to this one - screens and back look okay. Second phone has a battery that holds more charge, but not great. Within first five days of having it, the battery lost power extremely quickly with just normal use. The first time, phone completely shut off with no warning of a low battery, and had to be plugged in to be revived. The second time, battery dropped from 100% to 12% charge within 1-2 hours of unplugging it from outlet without much use. Aesthetically: phone is in decent shape, some scratches on the screen.

B01595SI9U	1	Don't expect long term investment I had this phone a while ago and it lasted about a year before my apps started deleting themselves every day. I'd reinstall them only to find they were deleted a few hours later. I ended up switching to a different phone but I really liked this one so about 4 months ago I ended up buying another one. Four months later the phone began freezing one morning and now keeps shutting itself off and refusing to turn on. I've had the phone for four months... I've been an android person my whole life but my experience with the Samsung Note 4 has really got me considering abandoning the Samsung family. 1;	-0.3	3.3

I've only had the device for a week and 3 days now, I've woken up to find that while properly plugged in, it didn't charge at all overnight. I do not recommend refurbished products from this seller for this reason - as it's common knowledge that charge ports fail and should be replaced in refurb devices. There's definitely no excuse for the charger being broken as well. Save your money for a different seller, or spend more and buy one new. 1;	-0.4	2.8

B01CJ3SCJ6	1	Becomes Slow and Buggy, Loses Performance Quickly This has been the worst phone I've ever owned. First, shortly after buying it, the screen stopped working and went black. I was lucky that I was able to exchange for another one (which was probably refurbished as well). Within less than a year of using the new phone, the phone has slowed to a crawl to where it takes 20 seconds to open the maps, or camera, or internet browser, or any other app. I've tried everything like keeping performance mode on, uninstalling all apps, safe mode, reset, etc. Still having issues. I don't think there is a virus or anything goofy on my phone. I recently started playing more with my work iPhone and will probably switch to iPhone. It will take some time to get used to it but it is a lot faster and doesn't seem to have all the software issues that Android has. I also don't like how Android doesn't give you the choice to cancel an update, after so many times of prolonging it, it will not give you a choice but will force you to install. Apps are also updating like twice a week which says a lot about the quality and reputability of the original publisher(s). What are they always changing twice a week? Who knows what these changes are and what they are doing to your phone and privacy, it is not fair that they don't always release notes regularly on what was changed. I am a programmer myself, and I have become more and more against open source code because all it does is invites everyone to hack-up your code and make your phone buggy and slow. I can see why iPhone is a lot more stable since Apple controls all of the code installed on their hardware. 1;	-0.3	7.5
B01CJ3SCJ6	1	Battery doesn't hold charge The battery is completely discharged within hours. It was sugested this is due to the phone being old (sitting around too long before being used). I haven't found a lot of functions to be obvious, such as adding a contact. However the battery issue makes it difficult. When I access the phone (Pressing the button at the bottom) the screen doesn't stay on for more than a second or 2, not long enough for me to read the Verizon msg posted on the entry screen. Every time I text I've been getting a msg asking if I want to turn on Samsung messaging whatever that is. 1;	-0.2	1.9

MetroPcs tried a few times to fix the problem, but it persisted...and when they passed the ball over to Verizon, verizon said all the S7 galaxy had been unloacked and they can do anything more. Bottom line....although the phone is unlocked, it is not compatible with other service providers other than Verizon - its original host.

B01DZJFWWS	1	Goodbye, Motorola I am a dedicated Motorola fan (18 years of mobile phones and every one has been a Motorola) and this phone has turned me firmly in the direction of Samsung. This phone worked fine for about 5 months and then started glitching. The phone turns itself off at random times and it takes numerous attempts to turn it on again (and sometimes the phone will not turn back on until it has been plugged into the charger). It will turn off when a call is coming in...turn off when a text message is coming in...turn off when playing a game such as Candy Crush or Words with Friends...turn off while just sitting there on the table and I'm not using it. This happens whether the phone has battery charge of 40% or 100%. Factory reset has not changed the situation. The phone went into a protective case with a screen protector as soon as it came out of the box and it has not been dropped or damaged in any way. No children play with this phone. So those reasons may be ruled out. What a disappointment this phone has been. 1;	-0.3	5.2

B01FCFZS3G	1	"5.5 ounce piece of Garbage \PROS: Looks good. Takes Great Pictures. Curved screen is nice, kinda. Sometimes the screen would do some weird input touches from the sides of my fingers wrapping around the phone. Hardly a cause for concern though. CONS: TERRIBLE cell service. No IR blaster. Back glass is FRAGILE! I have been using the Galaxy series of phones since the S4 and have enjoyed every variation until this complete disappointment of a phone. I can hardly even call it a phone since it would need to reliably make phone calls to be considered one. I don't live in some rural area countryside with poor cell service to begin with either. In fact quite the opposite. The suburbs of Long Island, where even when signal strength is a paltry 1-2 bars I could always make/receive phone calls and connect to the internet on the mobile network with my older devices. After battling with ATT about the network issues regarding this phone to no avail I am back to using my trusty old S6. I tried and tried using this phone hoping updates (there were 2 system updates) would address this issue. They did not. Over the weeks of use I would constantly need to restart my device to regain network connectivity. I would frequently have 2,3 or 4 bars of signal showing on the phone and no cell connection. In 1 instance a call dropped while driving on the expressway and the phone had not regained a cell connection for nearly 9 miles. 9 miles of the crossed out circle showing what this phone was truly worth. I had never had so much as a dropped call on my S6. Not once. This phone dropped calls daily. Text messages will flood in 3-4 at a time when the phone decides it is finally time to let you know people have been trying to get in touch with you all day. There are even times when on a 4G network connection with 3 bars the network connection doesn't work. (Pictures attached). That is the worst of this phone Nearly equally as bad is just how delicate the rear glass is. I never used cases on my S4, S5 or S6. Sure they would fall from the night stand from time to time but they would always hold up for as long as I had them. Cracks would develop over time from these mishaps but I am not even entirely sure the S7 Edge can survive normal use without becoming damaged. When I first had these network issues I figured I could always just resell the phone as used and cut my losses. This was mere weeks into using the phone. It was never dropped or misused. When I decided I could resell it because it was \""\""basically new\""\"" I carefully inspected the phone all over for any signs of wear thinking maybe there was a micro scratch or something from sliding it in and out of my pocket. Even worse. There were 2 single line cracks starting from the outer edge of the back glass traveling inward towards the center. NEVER DROPPED. I have no idea how these developed and had not noticed them before considering unloading this phone but they appeared to be stress cracks from flex. No defined spider web cracks indicating impact and honestly the phone was not dropped onto a hard or soft surface from even an inch of height. I decided I would just continue to use the phone and hope it would get better. Over the month and a half of use it did sustain one slip off the couch onto the floor and the rear glass now looks completely shattered. MY old S6 must have slipped off the bed or dresser at least a half dozen times in the last year and all it has to show for it is 1 crack along the back that you would not notice unless you really inspected it for damage. Maybe I just got a lemon in regards to the cell signal issue. There are plenty of people that have this phone and love it. The rear glass issue is probably something not isolated to just a few units though. This phone is not one to be used without a case of significantly rugged design if you want to preserve the back as crack free.\"" 1;"""	-0.2	21.4

B01FJT7E0A	1	Do NOT buy this phone - GPS function died after 6 months The phone looks good, as you would expect a Sony phone to look, but this is a very poorly manufactured phone that is glacially slow, takes poor photos, and most importantly, has a recurring GPS failure malfunction. So if you use this phone to navigate (Maps, Waze etc.) or call Taxis (Uber, Lyft etc.) then do NOT buy this phone. After 6 months the GPS function stopped working. So the phone no longer worked when I needed to use its as a GPS in my car. It also affected the location that Ubers would arrive when I called a taxi. After some research I saw that this is a recurring fault for this phone and thousands of other users had experienced the same problem. I contacted the seller (Vegas Electronics) who would take over a day to respond and all they did is just google the same potential solutions to the GPS malfunction (which didnt work). After I told the seller this they stopped responding to me. I contacted Sony, who offered to repair it. So I spent $20 sending it to them. A month later I received the phone back and it still had the same malfunctioning GPS! Sony either couldn't or didn't fix the problem. Im not going to spend another $20 sending it back to them so I will just throw this phone in the trash. I had previously bought Sony phones but this will be the last one.

B01FJT7E0A	1	Phone is nonfunctional after about a month of use This should should not be listed as a 16GB phone.

But if you don't need too many apps besides the basics than you'll be fine. However, you will not be able to escape the inevitable software problems of this phone after a few months of owning it. After about a month of use you will notice random shutdowns of the phone. It reaches a point around month 3 where the phone is practically unusable as it won't even turn on or will turn off after 5 minutes of use. I've never experienced a phone with more software issues as this and Sony Customer service will not benefit you. I've gone through multiple factory resets and software repairs and nothing has helped.

Normally, I'd chalk it up to poor network reception.. but no way.. my wife has an iPhone 7 on the same network (AT&T) and she can send/receive texts, make phone calls, watch videos, etc... and I can do NONE of those things. My phone drops calls like crazy, where hers is handling everything just perfectly. I had to buy and install a landline in order to make phone calls while home.

B01FJT7E3M	1	sucks so bad This is the most expensive budget phone I've bought and it sucks the worst. Bought it for $230 on sale in 2018 and started using it 4mo ago after the original battery and replacement battery on my old galaxy died. I've bought and set up a few budget phones for my dad because he breaks all electronics he touches. Got my two brothers Honor phones which were cheaper than this and works better. First off, it takes multiple swipes to unlock it. It locks back up at the drop of a hat and I can't figure something in settings that will stop it from sleeping & locking back up as soon as you're not tapping on it and no delay lock after you shut off the screen. I would be calling someone for half a minute and then as soon as I hang up it's on lockdown again. But what takes the cake is it doesn't receive calls. I probably miss half my calls because it never picks it up. And then to top it off, it doesn't ever show notifications that I have voicemail. So I could go a whole week before I have the next miss call and decide to check my voicemail and occasionally find a whole slew of them waiting for me. This phone is also a brick. It is heavy and big. I have trouble finding a pocket to fit it in and then it's a struggle to get it out of my pocket. My cell phone holder in the car unpeeled and fell off because of the weight of this thing. I swear my purse gains 5lbs after putting it in. Only positive is the decent battery life to make up for the size of this thing. 1;	-0.2	7.0
B01FJT7E3M	1	Great price, but very slow performance and severe lag with some apps and taking photos. I've had dozens of smart phones in the past couple of years - Iphone 6 plus, Sony Z3, Moto G4, and a bunch of cheaper no names as well. When I saw this phone on sale for Black Friday, I was excited to get it. After two months, the excitement has gone away. The major #1 problem with this phone is lag. Severely lag. Most apps work okay, but instagram, Photoshop, facebook and other programs that require more RAM run horribly. None of the navigation buttons would work sometimes. Also the camera is pretty good at taking photos. but only outdoors. Indoors its a noisy mess. And yes, there's lag with the camera too. Often times I would take a photo or two, and then I'll check my photo app, there's no photos there. Like where did it go Sony? Oh yeah, lag. Even though there's 3 gb of ram, the CPU is so old and slow, nothing gets done. My old Moto G4 had none of these problems and it had 2gb of ram and a similar CPU. And its January 2018 and its still running Android 7.0 with security patches from August 2017.

Screen was so delicate that the bottom corner chipped off after an accidental drop (in 11/2017) while in protective casing. Vertical and horizontal lines appeared on the screen blurring text/images a month after drop. Sony Mobile Support and their RMA/Repair process was useless since they returned my phone unrepaired (due to physical damage) and did not communicate with me the entire month they held onto my device. Too bad I didn't read reviews about well-known screen malfunctions with Xperia models prior to purchasing this phone. Sony voided my warranty and will not repair the vertical/horizontal lines issue caused by their inferior hardware. Phone is completely unusable in 2/2018 due to screen no longer responding to touch.

B01FJT7E3M	1	"Worthless. Save your money unless you like buying GARBAGE. \The short version: it's pretty bad. Here are the issues: 1. Bloatware. 2. Inability to move apps to your memory card, which results in a laughably small amount of usable space thanks to the aforementioned bloatware. 3. Sonys infuriating AVLS which cannot be turned off, adjusted, or changed in any way. 4. Inability to remove, customize, or change settings for all of the bloatware and proprietary garbage. 5. Bluetooth device button problems. 6. WiFi problems. 7. Randomly freezes or refuses to turn on. 8. Randomly bricked itself, erasing everything on it earlier this year. 9. Terrible button placement. 10. Inability to customize led color for different types of notifications. The good: 1. The cameras 2. The large screen The long version: I'm on my second phone. The first one overheated while charging after only a month and a half of use, cracking the screen near the camera. Sony support was useless. Put me on a waiting list to have my phone serviced. I've still never received a call or email. Amazon, however, stepped up immediately and was kind enough to replace the phone. So I set up the second phone, and go through all of the updates (which took about two hours). Everything seems to be fine. I get to work, where I listen to my bluetooth headset the entire shift to drown out the awful music they pipe through the building. Bluetooth connects, no big deal. Turn the volume up, and it stops at about 65%. It's unreasonably low. There was no warning, and there is no way to bypass the limiter. So I get to spend my entire day having Motorhead and Danzig gently whispering to me while still hearing all of the noises I'm trying to drown out. I like my music fairly loud, and the manufacturer of my phone shouldn't have a say in whether or not I am allowed to do this. It turns out, there's no way to bypass this software nanny without rooting the phone and voiding my warranty. I've never done this, and the process looks very time consuming and complicated. I really shouldn't have to do all of this crap just so I can listen to music at the volume I want. What makes me the most furious is that my previous Xperia, the one that overheated, didn't have this problem. I turned the volume to whatever level I wanted. Zero issues. As far as what I like about the phone, the cameras are quite good, the screen looks good enough for me, and it's really big. But that's as far as it goes, really. More bad than good with this thing. UPDATE: A few weeks after writing this review, the volume limiter has disappeared after a random software update. Hopefully the problem doesn't show up again. Everything is working as it should. UPDATE 1/15/2018: After about two and a half months, the phone has the occasional hiccup. An app not working properly, or whatever. I usually just restart it, and it's fine. Today, I restarted the phone, and nothing. It sat on the \""\""Xperia\""\"" screen for 20 minutes before I reset it again. Same thing. It just hangs out on the Xperia screen and refuses to do anything. I \""\""repaired\""\"" the phone using Sony's software  Xperia Companion. The phone has finally rebooted. It completely wiped the slate. All of my photos;"""	-0.2	28.9
B01FJT7E3M	1	Design is awkward, speaker is terrible. I switched to Android from iPHone, so a lot of my issues are really just problems with adjusting. But I'm finding that my biggest struggle with this phone has to do with the hardware. The screen is beautiful, but it's a large phone--and the volume button is placed exactly where your hand lands no matter how you hold it. I keep missing calls and texts because the volume has shut down accidentally. I also miss the tactile nature of the iPhone Home button and the slider button for turning the whole thing on and off. Update Aug 2017: Downgraded from two stars to one, as the speaker stopped working almost entirely. Nothing on speaker, and nothing louder than a faint whisper on earpiece. Fine when playing media but useless for phone calls or checking voicemail. It's pretty bad when a phone doesn't work as a phone. I've spent hours trying to fix, to no avail.

I don't replace phones often. This is a conscious choice....if I keep one around for a while than I don't contribute often to a system where the constructors of cells are exposed to lead, lose their eye sight etc. So, it was quite a shock to see how much has changed in what...3 years....Really America?

I see that some reviewers are not mentioning the seller so that readers don't have this information when shopping. I'm not going to spend much time reviewing the iPhone SE or iOS, but only this unit. I purchased a new iPhone SE 64GB from Apple in April, 2016 as soon as it was released. I prefer a smaller phone that I can use with one hand and carry in a jeans pocket. I like the SE. 64GB is plenty for me. I had the iPhone 6 and it was uncomfortable to hold and difficult to use. Anyway, I dropped my SE on a brick floor last week, shattering the screen. I wanted to buy a new one with AppleCare+ but found Apple has discontinued this model. It's not in their online store. I checked all the Apple Retail Stores within 60 miles, then Target, Best Buy and even WalMart. There were none. I turned to Amazon. The only new SE was 32GB, which is too little storage for me. I saw all the \""\""Certified Refurbished\""\"" units and thought they seemed incredible. I would be able to get a like-new SE for less than half the price of a new one. I have bought refurbished products in the past and they are usually a bargain because they've been checked out thoroughly and the buyer can count on them being in good working order  although not cosmetically perfect.

I also got a lightweight cover so the phone would stay compact. Two months after purchasing the phone she dropped it. It landed face-down and the LCD exploded like a bomb. Not covered under warranty, thank you very much for the money. Try a new one! Bottom line... if you are clumsy, get an otter box and hope that helps.

The bracket was missing, the SIM tray had been replaced, and it was all sealed with regular Krazy glue. Luckily, they were able to repair and replace the parts for a low cost.

Speakerphone does(still no mic). Also headset jack does not work, so i had to connect a blue tooth to try to make calls. Tried contacting them 4 business days ago, with no response. According to Amazon this was a new device. Though it appeared brand new to the eye(housing and display perfect), this clearly has to be refurbished.

B01M7O431L	1	This phone is not worth it DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!! I bought this phone and it was fine for about 2 o 3 weeks before it started to malfunction. The phone would start itself when opening certain apps like netflix, but that was just the beginning. after about a month and a half after i bought it the phone went completely crazy, it would shut off randomly without it even being used, it would spend entire days and nights restarting itself over and over again. i took it to be fixed after one night it just stopped working entirely. i took it to get fixed, but i was told that there was nothing that could be done so now the phone sits in a drawer after a couple months of using it. my LG 3 lasted for nearly 4 years and this phone could not last 3 months.save yourself the trouble and money this phone will cost you. 1;	-0.6	5.1

B01M7O431L	1	Not too happy with my refurbished phone. This refurbished phone was purchased from dealfisher- a seller recommended by amazon. 1) came with non-OEM not rapid charger 2)screen seemed slightly less sensitive than what's considered normal. 3)later realized my phone gets about half the wifi speeds as my fiance- we live together and my phone is WAY slower than his s7edge. My battery doesnt last NEARLY as long- I literally have to charge it multiple times in a day- its always in battery saving mode- That can't be normal. The final straw? My camera is crap. I thought maybe the lens got dirty or my case was covering it (my case doesn't cover it). Its progressively gotten worse and everything looks like it's some weird filter and the resultion is crap. Then I realized it's not even focusing correctly. Its been 2 months since I purchased this. I let a lot of things go as far as accepting the unacceptable, but the camera is truly a deal breaker. 1;	-0.5	6.8

I have to continuosly turn off and on the phone to make it respond because the situation limits the funcionality and the phone becomes unresponsive.

B01N4E0RF1	1	0 for 3 on Bluetek refurbished phones I have been through 3 Galaxy S7 refurbished phones supplied by Bluetek. None have worked. The first lasted a few weeks, then started a perpetual reboot cycle. Bluetek seemed very responsive and agreed to replace it, although they insisted that I send the old one back first, or buy a new one and wait for a refund. I bought a new one. The replacement had a bad antenna and would not recognize the SIM card or access the network. The replacement for that one just arrived and it does not even seem to be a Verizon network device. Also, will not access network,does not have any of the standard apps included, and does not respond to normal commands, like the Volume Down+Power command to go to the reset menu. The prices look good, but if I can't get a working phone, it is worthless. 1;	-0.4	4.7

B01N9XOXCK	1	Not too happy with my refurbished phone. This refurbished phone was purchased from dealfisher- a seller recommended by amazon. 1) came with non-OEM not rapid charger 2)screen seemed slightly less sensitive than what's considered normal. 3)later realized my phone gets about half the wifi speeds as my fiance- we live together and my phone is WAY slower than his s7edge. My battery doesnt last NEARLY as long- I literally have to charge it multiple times in a day- its always in battery saving mode- That can't be normal. The final straw? My camera is crap. I thought maybe the lens got dirty or my case was covering it (my case doesn't cover it). Its progressively gotten worse and everything looks like it's some weird filter and the resultion is crap. Then I realized it's not even focusing correctly. Its been 2 months since I purchased this. I let a lot of things go as far as accepting the unacceptable, but the camera is truly a deal breaker. 1;	-0.5	6.8

B01N9YOVME	1	LOCKED Phone was in great shape. That's about all that can be said that's positive. This phone was NOT unlocked, despite sellers assurances it is, and they were caught in a lie about it. They stated the unlock code was provided by Samsung. I called Samsung, who stated they do NOT provide unlock codes. Locks are set by carriers, and cannot be unlocked by Samsung. Samsung also said these phones are out of warranty and as such Samsung wont touch them anyway. No service when I put in my SIM. A call to Straight Talk ĺwhich other reviewers say will work) revealed the phone is locked through ATT. I called ATT and they verified it is indeed locked, they checked using the IMEI number. They cannot unlock it without previous owners permission and suggested I call Samsung. I did so, and Samsung agreed its locked by ATT. I talked to ATT again, who said nothing can be done. Their own words, the phone as is, is worthless, cannot be used. I sent all this to Mobile USA, who argued that the three companies and I are all wrong. the phones fine. After some back and forth they offered a refund or exchange. I see no reason to believe another phone wouldnt be the same. I wont be getting another through Mobile USA. 1;	-0.3	7.6

B01NH5HCGZ	1	very bad phone I bought this phone as a replacement to my original moto that I bought in 2017, I have had this refurbished phone in January and started having the same trouble that I had with my original moto in 2017. I just went to return this phone and it said I couldn't return it as of May 1, 2019. I bought a new samgsung on April 30th and I have been working on transferring all my stuff from the the moto Z droid to the samsung, as the battery on my moto is stupid, it shuts off every time you try to use it. I even had the added moto mod battery for extra battery power and it didn't help it took me 6 days to get all my photos, contacts, videos, etc to my new samsung. I would tell anyone thinking of buying a moto Z droid NOT TO BUY THIS PHONE IT'S NOTHING BUT aggravation and DOESN'T WORK CORRECTLY FOR LONG AT ALL. My original moto started acting up back in 2017, so i bought the moto mod battery and it helped for a bit, but then just kept shutting down. So I then bought the refurbished unit and it only lasted 2 months before it started shutting down during use and not staying charged at all. DO NOT BUY A MOTO Z DORID 1;	-0.7	5.6
B01NH5HCGZ	1	Very Disappointed I bought this Motorola Z Droid Edition because I had used one for two years and really liked it and wanted to replace it with another one; my first one at two years old was not keeping up with the battery life. Didn't want to pay $700-$800 for one and didn't want to extend my contract. Thought this was a great way to go -- Certified Refurbished, Verizon-capable. However, I am very disappointed in this certified refurbished phone. Right out of the box, the battery isn't any better than my two-year-old phone - yes, it turbo-charges well on my original turbo-charger from my old phone,, but it also dies faster and at somewhere between 25 and 50%, completely dies without warning. Also the up-down volume buttons on the side don't work at all. In order to increase/decrease my volume, I have to go into Settings and change it on the screen. At $140 I had hoped for something better. 1;	-0.4	4.3
B01NH5HCGZ	1	Battery life is terrible This phone never worked properly. The battery may last a few hours or 15 mins. The phone would shut down like the battery was dead even though it had 30% life on it. There is no way a technician checked this phone before they sold it. Will not purchase from this seller again 1;	-0.5	2.6

I followed all prompts on the box to activate the phone and none of them worked I even paid the plan for the month because that \""\""supposedly\""\"" would activate the phone (which didn't) instead it gave me a # with the last 4 digits missing from it so I don't even know the # to the phone. I called Verizon's customer service and couldn't get through to no one. The automated system kept asking for different #'s on the box which I couldn't give because labels had been placed over all of the information on the box. When I finally got through the representatives kept giving me #'s for the prepaid department that didn't work so finally I decided to go to the corporate Verizon store to find out apparently the sim card that comes with the phone wasn't the right one so the store had to call customer care to get another one sent out (still waiting...) phone overall isn't bad but the Camera quality isn't good.

B06XS2GWFC	1	I Hate this Phone This phone is slower than molasses. I bought a new phone because my last one was just too bogged down with updates and patches to work fast enough for me.

It stops at times but then it starts again like it's pretty soon is just going to go blank on me and never turn on again. Pretty frustrating knowing that you just paid $300 for this phone and in 2 months and a half I feel like this going down the drain. Now I really don't know what to do or who to get in contact with to see if it's possible I can send this phone back and they can send me another one or the bad news that I might have to buy another one😠😭😠, is very frustrating when this is your first time and don't really know what exactly to do. 1;	-0.3	4.2

B06XSF5C42	1	That the dealer didn't send an unlocked phone like stated I bought myself a s7edge and love it. The only reason I am giving such a bad review is because we bought an unlocked phone so, as we wanted a certified refurbished, that would work on Verizon. When we tried to put this onto our Verizon account and switch out the old phone, it wouldn't work. It stated we needed a T Mobile sims card. Now we have to send it back and find a Verizon, certified refurbished, dealer and phone. It is hard that I have to wait to get my $ back and order a new one at the same time.

B06XZRZ12Q	1	Phone was probably never tested Bought this as a replacement for a Galaxy S7 that had a broken screen from Re-Cell. Transferred everything to the new phone using wi-fi to get at gmail backups, but noticed that the screen was not very responsive. Took the phone off wi-fi and could not get a G4 signal, only SMS messages worked. Called T-Mobile on another phone and spent 2 hours going over settings with two support people, who said the phone appeared to be configured for T-Mobile, but could not explain why it wouldn't connect to their servers. Took it to a T-Mobile store where a very knowledgeable associated also commented that the phone screen had some kind of problem, and could not figure out why it would not go onto a T-Mobile network. They suggested that I return or replace the phone, as the problems would likely get worse. In the end I traded the phone for what I spent on it for a new phone, but I'll never get the approximately 8 hours total I wasted on this useless phone and the experience of buying it. I have to wonder if it was ever tested by Re-Cell - it looked like new, but my guess is it was initially defective and resold regardless. 1;	-0.6	5.9

TWICE! Bought phone in November 2017. Was excited to try 4k screen. Reviewers raved about it, saying the resolution was stunning and that the difference was definitely noticeable. Not the case! The screen quality was just not that great, colors were bland and resolution was not noticeably different from a QHD screen. Was using the ZTE Axon 7 prior to switching to the Xperia XZ Premium. Immediately disappointed by the screen!! The ZTE Axon 7 uses AMOLED while Xperia XZ Premium uses LCD. With phones side by side playing the same videos in each respective resolution (4K on Xperia, QHD on Axon), the Axon 7 consistently had better looking images, with much richer blacks and contrasts. The difference in resolution is not noticeable, as much as I tried to see the differences between QHD and 4K, It was so minute I had to pause the videos and look very closely at the images to spot the slightest differences. In other words, it is a useless spec that looks good on paper, but underperforms in real world, because the AMOLED QHD screen on the Axon 7 looked better in every way. Even the HDR looked poor. I preferred the non HDR video coming out of the Axon 7's screen. Decided to keep the Xperia XZ Premium for the overall experience, decent camera, great processor, good OS without too many bloatware, water proofing etc. It is a decent phone overall, however, the GPS functionality decided to stop working all together, and this is where the nightmare began. Phone does not get any signal at all from satellites and so using Google Maps or any other location based service is useless. We all know how important GPS functionality is today on a phone, it is a feature we cannot be without. Called Sony and they recommended a full factory reset using their computer software that you download. No fix. Called Sony and they sent me a FEDEX label to ship phone to their repair center. Keep in mind they do not offer a loaner device, so I had to figure that out on my own. Sent phone, did not receive any news from them for 3 weeks. Call to get an update and they say that all they know is that the phone is in the repair shop, but they don't know the status. Another week goes by and I call and implore them to fix the phone already and send it back. They say they will try. Phone is sent back to me a few days later, and the paper from the repair shop says \""\""repaired  software reinstalled\""\"" . Pop in SIM card and restart phone and GPS has SAME PROBLEM. Call them again and begin process again to send it back. Talk to a supervisor who states that the technicians do check and ensure phone is working properly.

I could receive and place calls, but the phone would not ring and I was unable to hear the ther Party (but oddly they could hear me clearly). Navigation apps worked but audio directions did not function. Very disappointed in the lack of longevity of this product.

B06ZZVZKTR	1	SIM reader failure on 2 different phones I wish I'd read and he'd more reviews here. The first one of these we bought lasted just over a month before it stopped recognizing the SIM card. There is nothing we could do to restore it. Thinking it a fluke, we bought another... it lasted one week. These phones have a software issue so that if they range out of service area for too long, they stop recognizing SIM cards. Otherwise, they are nice little phones. But with the error, they can't call or send or receive texts. 1;	-0.3	3.6

B06ZZVZKTR	1	Cute but unusable after 3 months I was so happy to get this phone. I had been using a old fashioned pre-paid phone for the longest and was ready to switch. I liked the fact that it looked high end and based on some of the positive reviews I went for it...BUTTTT....Along with all of the positive feedback, there were quite a few negative ones about the problems with this phone and I wish I WOULD'VE LISTENED!! I only had this phone for 3 months and already its dropping calls left and right, If I try to make a call it won't go through or if someone calls me they cant get thru and it goes straight to voicemail, If I do get to talk on this phone, nobody can hear what I'm saying or they say that my voice sounds like I'm talking underwater, also the volume will randomly stop working for media videos (Youtube,fb,IG), or if I'm making calls I cant hear the ringing on my end. Even if I remove the battery, the problem persists and grows progressively worse. When I googled how to fix it, I found that these are well known common issues with this phone and there is very little if anything the company can do about it. So now after only 3 months I'm forced into using my old phone, till I can get something else. I encourage yall to not be tricked by this phone..its cute, but thats it. 1;	-0.3	5.5

B071VTYHDQ	1	Depending on what you pay.. great value [edit: sound problems, many other quirks with OS and phone that I hate after a few weeks with it] Buying on Amazon was a mistake; I didn't realize you could get it for $40 from ---mart and pick up locally. For $40 the phone is a great value. For $80 on Amazon, it's a good value. I expected an upgrade from my previous LG Optimus Exceed 2, and I got one. In terms of performance, anyway. But the build quality and design of the Moto is not as good. Feels cheaper and lacks a few features that even that 2013 phone had, such as tap to wake and a flashing light to alert for messages -- the Moto you have to wake it with power button to see if you have messages. Six million times a day. This causes exactly the kind of drain on attention that make phones such a life-destroying force. The LG dropped on the floor face down many times and never broke because the screen was flat and small. This Moto is made of slippery plastic and the screen has a slight curve, so it *will* drop and it *will* break if you don't get a case. The ridge where the screen meets the case is designed to collect dust - not smart. The camera seems great to me, although not as good as an iphone (even iphone 4). Overall I'm satisfied, but surprised that I miss the old phone, especially the feel of the rubberized back. You *will* drop this phone. The keyboard (the google keyboard) is much, much worse than the LG keyboard layout, so it is hard to even type a text message, but that's not Moto's bad. There have been some issues with the sound, and it did crash once or twice even though it's new and there is hardly anything on the phone. Still it's probably on par with anything you can get for this price. 1;	0.0	7.4

B071ZDQ6MV	1	Don't bother...laggy & SW bugs. Hoped this was going to be a good option for me as I've always had Android and I am not ok with paying over $500 for a cell phone. At first, I was very happy with the phone. The design aesthetic is on point; nice weight, size, aluminum housing, but after a few days things just started to annoy me. First thing I noticed was that the automatic network-provided time was acting up. It kept forcing me to EST although I'm PST. Eventually, I had to deselect the automatic updated time and manually select PST to make sure. After some time, I reverted to auto updated time and it worked until I went to Texas and time again reverted to EST. Never had this issue before with any other phone, and it's especially annoying when you travel and have no idea what time it is. It's also not ideal when you depend on your cell phone as your alarm clock. There aren't a lot of accessories available for this phone so I chose a screen protector that had decent reviews. The screen protector was not made of glass and it had a soft feel to it. The softness eventually led to some indentations but still worked. This review is not about screen protector but I noticed after installing, the added depth near the fingerprint reader created some reliability issues there. I'd keep tapping and it wouldn't recognize so I'd have to unlock with the dot pattern. Lastly, the phone got really slow and laggy very soon after getting it. I put in a Class 10 micro SD card as is recommended so I don't think it's related to that. I even noticed, while getting ready to return and wipe the phone, that after removing the screen protector, SIM and SD card, the phone stopped being so laggy. Not sure what's going on but I can't recommend this phone. On to the next one... 1;	-0.2	9.9

I purchased 2 other USB cables and tried 2 or more other USB cables in attempt to charge the battery. None of these alternate cables worked. However, these cables did charge another Android device. When I used the cable supplied, which was split and worn, the phone began to unreliably charged.

I talked to a man who was the service contact provided for this, he said they're phasong out these phones due to complaints and because all of the pixels coming in are trash and Amazon is not vetting the phones or repairing them before resale. Amazon has literally sold me trash. This phone was scratched up and I was okay with that until I realized it had probably been dropped multiple times with no case on it. I had a phone before that I dropped on its side without a case and it had electrical issues afterwards. This phone seemed okay at first but it ran very slow, and suddenly the screen started to go black. I had already ported my number and tried calling someone but the audio jack didn't work, and the actual speaker system wad messed up because I couldn't never be heard when calling. It also made intermittent weird electronic static sounds. This isn't some cheap $5 phone you found in a bin at a garage sale. Amazon is selling these for over $100 and they are very literally the trash that someone else broke and sent back to Amazon. I would advise you not to even try with one of these phones. Based on my conversation with the person who was in charge of complaints, it's not even worth exchanging for the same phone because the whole lot of pixel ones is bad and not being repaired before resale.

My mistake. I ended up ordering 3 google pixels (renewed). The first arrived in good condition, but battery capacity was only at 70% worse then the 80% advertised as the minimum. So I decided to order another to get one with a better battery. The second arrived with the microphone not working. After troubleshooting contacted amazon and a replacement unit was quickly sent out. Then I received the replacement and the microphone did not work again and this time the aux jack didn't either. At this point I probably should have just given up, but thought the replacement process went so easy I'll try one more time why not. Big mistake.

(Kanga supply) I won't make this long because I didnt have a working phone for a long time, (total time 7 months) started having issues, (two months in) the phone has bad audio problems, I noticed no matter what headphones I used, expensive or cheap, the audio for calls and music was terrible, I could barely hear anything, but I saw that issue on some reviews of this phone before so I adjusted, but now I can't hear anything by the top ear thing. The audio and speaker on the phone doesn't work. When someone calls I can't hear them and music doesn't play at all. Tried to see if I could get it repaired, cost more than the phone cost.

Weird how the amazon stamp of approval is used so liberally now. Amazon products are trash in general, this refurbished pixel is no different. Don't get taken. 1;	-0.5	3.7
B071ZN4K8V	1	Latest Android update breaks this phone This phone shipped with Oreo 8.1. The mic would sometimes fail, requiring a reboot. Since a reboot would fix it, I did not think of returning the phone until after a couple more updates. Then the Android Pie (9) came along.. that update broke the whole phone. The system process would just stop and freeze the UI and the phone would need a hard reboot (when you press the power button until the phone just restarts). Safe mode would make it a bit more stable, but it would eventually fail anyway. Factory reset didn't help. The phone is very nice, very good quality materials, but unusable with the current Android. I had to send it back. 1;	-0.2	2.7
B071ZN4K8V	1	Phone crashes so often enough that I question the refurb From the start, I was disappointed in the phone. The battery life is laughable, and if you listen to music or podcasts, you'll be lucky to get 10 hours. Ultimately the deal-breaker for me though are the frequent crashes that cause the phone to restart. I've had the phone for a little over 2 months, and what started as a once a week event is now multiple times a day. It takes nice pictures though. In short, if you pick your phones based on their ability to take pretty pictures, then this is the phone for you. If you choose your phones based on their reliability, then pick anything else. 1;	-0.2	3.2
B071ZN4K8V	1	Absolute garbage. I have to keep this phone on the charger all day. It dies at 20% battery. When I try to make phone calls, the phone freezes. When I try to answer calls it freezes. It has fits where it will shut off by itself and I have to hold down the power button for like 15 seconds for it to come back on, only for it to shut off again 30 seconds later. It's extremely slow. It will not connect to my Bluetooth devices. It won't play sound through my aux cord. I assume that's the head phone jack not working. It's just awful. The camera is nice though. That's the only good thing I have to say about it. 1;	-0.4	7.5
B071ZN4K8V	1	Buyer Beware This is my third Google phone that stopped working after a software update. Google touts that you are always on the latest version, but what they don't tell you is that they use software updates to make your phone stop working so you buy their newer version. Moreover, Google's customer service is awful! Go Samsung or Apple and avoid the Pixel like the plague. 1;	-0.5	2.3
B071ZN4K8V	1	Lasted 7 months I bought a certified refurbed Pixel from Amazon.com Services, Inc. The phone was in good condition, albeit did not come with a fast charger. Unfortunately the phone has lasted all of 7 months. I had to factory reset it 3 times since I've owned it, which resolved the issues temporarily. This last time I reset it, even with only stock apps, the phone crashes every few hours and abruptly drops calls or exhibits no audio on calls. There's no warranty or support, so I've spent the equivalent of $45/mo on a phone that only worked half the time. I won't be trusting Amazon Refurbs ever again. 1;	-0.3	2.8
B071ZN4K8V	1	Don't buy from BuySpry The phone I received from Buyspry was not the quality I expected; the battery life was terrible, and it kept shutting down while registering 20+% battery life. I attempted to return the product, and after BuySpry approved the return and I sent it in to them, they told me it was outside of their return window....sooooo I guess I'm out both $200 and the phone I already sent in AFTER THEY APPROVED THE RETURN? If I could rate lower than 1 star, I would at this point. 1;	-0.4	2.0
B071ZN4K8V	1	"\\""\""Certified Refurbished\""\"" means nothing\"" Even though I love this phone's UI and better battery life than my old phone, I still do not recommend buying this phone from this seller as I believe who ever certified it refurbished beleived thier repair fixed the phone but actually they made it worse as I have found several faults other users have not had like the mircophone malfunctioning every time you try and use it, the headphone jack not working even after I restart the phone, it crashes all most every morning now and crashes every time I try to answer a phone call, and the screen acts asthough it is being distorted at least once a day. 1;"""	-0.4	0.9
B071ZN4K8V	1	Poor quality work I purchased a google pixel at the end of August. If you are buying refurbished would strongly recommend not using this company. I keep my phone in a life proof case and it just shut off the other day, I took it to a trusted repairman and he told me not only I there a clip missing that holds the lcd in place but the phone and not been replied shut after repair so it was just a matter of time before this happened. He told me never to use this company again, that they are putting out poorly refurbished phones. 1;	-0.6	3.4
B071ZN4K8V	1	Broke 1 week after 90 day warranty Phone app in phone (used to make all phone calls) stopped working properly 97 days after purchase. If it had broken just a week earlier, it could have used the warranty to fix. Now i have to spend almost $250 again on another phone. 1;	-0.3	1.6
B071ZN4K8V	1	Phone suddenly died after a few months. In less than 6 months this phone just went completely dead (nothing to do with the charge as it was charged when it happened). Just went black and no one could start it up again. As the battery is not removable, there was no way to try taking it out and putting it back in. We took it to a cell phone repair place and they couldn't get it to come back to life. They suspected it was the motherboard, but they really didn't know. A huge waste of our money. 1;	-0.5	4.6
B071ZN4K8V	1	Headphone jack defective. The headphone jack was defective. It makes a screeching distortion sound even when nothing is playing. This PPalm Logistics (the seller) clearly didn't even test this thing. JUNK. 1;	-0.6	3.5
B071ZN4K8V	1	not sure why i spent $200 on a broken phone Great phone if you're looking for a gag gift! in fact i loved it so much i bought it twice! both phones were broken and I am once again left phoneless. Looks like some people who bought this got a working phone which is great, but I would personally advise you not to risk buying this phone because based on reviews (and personal experience) theres about a 50/50 chance you'll end up with a broken phone. 1;	-0.3	1.2

B071ZN4K8V	1	Battery was a dud - looks like they don't replace them with new ones When I got the phone it ran hot just being plugged in. In use battery did not last long (5-6 hours just playing audio with the screen off, 2 hours with the screen on). Finally, after about a week of ownership, I was out late and the battery ran low enough for the phone to shut down. When I got home and plugged it in using the provided charging cable and plug it showed a red blinking light (not enough power to turn on) that never went away even after 12 hours plugged in. Phone will not turn on. UPDATE: Contacted Kanga supply about a return. Asked for a replacement / refund via Amazon and got a reply from Kanga Supplying which said to email with the tracking number. I did so and never received a response. I tried calling the CS line and could not get through. Return package arrived at their address a week earlier before I reached out. I called them and got through to the CS line. I was told I had to give them the pin to unlock my phone. This information was not conveyed as needed in the return instructions nor did anyone reach out to me to inform me this was needed. Be forewarned: Kanga Supply does not have the most effective Customer Service Update: I had to manually call them twice to have them issue a refund. This is after being told on the first call that if the info I gave them went through they'd issue a refund. They issued on the phone during the second call. If you get a dud from them don't expect getting it replaced or refunded to be an easy process 1;	-0.3	6.5

The buttons on the side are reversed from the phone, the headset port hole is in the wrong place, and, if you can actually get the phone all the way in the case, you probably wont be able to charge the phone because the port hole is too high. If you opt to take the cover off, it is so tight, that it will pull the back of the phone off. Do Not Purchase this if you have a Moto E Plus 4G. 1;	-0.4	2.9

B072ZWCKP5	1	disappointed Problems with volume. Not as user friendly as my old LG and more enmeshed with google to function properly. In setting up contacts, the phone pulled in information from all my email addresses into phone that I did not want and left out some important phone #'s I transferred from old phone. Phone #'s, important ones, disappear and reappear into contacts, sometimes duplicating, sometimes disappearing. I've been saved by still having the contact information on another phone. Love the camera and that was what sold me; but I think I might have to send back with the other problems. Or just keep the phone as a camera only. The two most important things I was looking for was camera and dual sim capability. Other Amazon descriptions of otherMoto E Plus phones on Amazon show the dual sim card availability. This one didn't specifically say it accepted dual sim cards; but stated it was Verizon and AT&T compatible, leading me to believe that it was. It is not a dual sim card phone. I missed important calls while traveling last week and now will change out to Verizon card. If no better, I need to check if I still have time to send back. Later edit: The phone did not work at all with the Verizon Sim Card. 1;	-0.1	4.9

They asked me to bring it in so they could ‘hard code’ it into the system, whatever that means.

B074P5FMG5	1	Poor screen and camera quality. Budget Motorola phones have better screen and camera quality than this! I’m giving this one star because the screen quality and the camera quality is monumentally poorer than even my mom’s $150 Moto G. For $650 I would expect better camera quality and screen quality than a $150 budget phone! I ended up returning this phone. I had high hopes thinking Sony is a good quality brand. I really liked the square design of the phone. However, there is a very visible grid that appears over everything on the screen, possibly due to the way the screen pixels are laid out, and it is way too obvious and noticeable to be considered “a good quality screen”, I tried to give it a chance but this highly noticeable grid overlaying everything is just not tolerable for me. I was also really disappointed with the camera quality too. I compared the photos taken with this phone to the photos on my mom’s Moto G (a very cheap budget phone) and the camera quality is noticeable greater on this little budget phone. I’ll be sending this one back and getting a Moto X4. 1;	-0.3	6.2

B074VFRKZG	1	Bricked twice (at least it's till under warranty) These phone are pretty and very functional. HOWEVER Within three months of original purchase it would no longer charge. Although I found a handy blog where someone showed that if you press a nickel between the back of the phone and a protective case which restored the charging function (something to do with the internal heat sensor malfunctioning), that's a dumb way to live with a BRAND NEW PHONE. So I returned it under warranty to Motorola (paying $25 for their expedited phone in hand version). That was a month and a half ago, and now the replacement will no longer turn on. The phone is great, when it works, but since it dies on its own (never dropped, kept in TPS case with screen protector) I would avoid like the plague. I note now they are extremely discounted on the Moto website. I figure this is the why. 1;	-0.3	3.2

Update: After numerous calls to Consumer Cellular, AT&T, and Samsung seems there is no way to completely 'unlock' this tablet. The 'phone' app is useless unless you have a myAT&T account ($$$). There is a workaround as you can find the Hangouts app for phone calls in the app store and make phone calls through it. (Not able to receive calls or texts).

B075FKVJV3	1	S...L...O...W. phone I hate to leave a bad review. However, since I have cursed this phone out at least 3 times per day since I started using it, I figure it’s time. First of all, I should have paid more attention to the “one star reviews” from actual victims....I mean users of this phone. I was too busy reading the good reviews of cheap phones from techies about the fabulous battery life and nice body of the phone. Durability. I completely ignored the innumerable warnings about how S L O W this phone is. I’m not ADHD or anything like that, but I am a senior citizen and I’d like to accomplish some things on this phone before I can’t remember how to. Like how to return to a call in progress if I hit any key on the phone with my face and wonder why the party I was conversing with hangs up saying “where did you go!” Or the good old days on my cheap $30 phone that lasted for years would light up when a message came in. Or waiting eternally for the home screen to come back so I can go on to something else I need to do. I have decided to give up and get another phone. I am going to put it in a drawer, label it “spare phone” and let my son get a hold of it in an emergency. It’s demise will be swift.....my son will put it out of its misery less than 10 minutes into using it. So, for the time being, there is a stay of execution. 1;	-0.1	5.1
B075FKVJV3	1	Remarkably Tragic I replaced an old Samsung S5mini with this gem I bought on Prime Day and all I have to show for it is regret. This phone takes at least three, five, even ten seconds to do ANYTHING, including simply opening factory-loaded apps. So, I want to open the clock to set an alarm? Launch the clock and wait so long that I forgot why I was setting an alarm to begin with. No worries – I only set alarms for the unimportant things. Want to snap pic? Use the convenient double-tap power button shortcut to open the camera… except the camera took so long to load, I missed the shot. Doesn’t matter – I only take pictures of things I don’t want to remember. Slow. Unresponsive. Trash. After enduring this tragedy, it makes me miss my old Samsung S5mini and it was FOUR YEARS OLD. This Nokia makes me long for the good old days of mild frustration rather than unbridled rage. Positives? I like headphone jacks it was cheap enough so that I have the cash to buy a functioning phone. I suppose that might be worth a star. 1;	-0.2	5.4
B075FKVJV3	1	Not a 2018's smartphone I bought this phone because the price and the brand have a good impact in front of the human eye, and at first glance this phone seemed like a good phone, a good purchase, plus I bought it on the Prime Day. Sadly, I found that Nokia keeps its mind in 2000's, the phone gets too warm when it has about one hour of uninterrupted use, also, sometimes it takes too long to react when I'm trying to navigate among all the opened apps, and sometimes its screen freezes so hard that I have to reboot it; 8GB storage and 1GB RAM is so ridiculous, this is 2018, you can't ask for 100$ for this. The camera is not good either, when I take a picture, I have to wait a while to take another picture, camera's speed reaction is bad. The only feature that works but is not worthy is its battery, the battery may last about 2 days in a regular day (only the neccesary). This is what i meant when I said that Nokia keeps its mind in 2000's 1;	-0.3	3.2
B075FKVJV3	1	Slowest, most frustrating phone I have ever owned in my entire life. Don't buy this. Seriously. You will regret it just like I currently am regretting owning this phone. Allow me to explain. The phone has less than 900 Mb of memory. This means it has difficulty running many apps with higher requirements. I literally can't download some regular apps that shouldn't be an issue for a phone, because those apps require a gig of RAM. 1 gig of RAM is not some hefty amount at this day and age. This phone cannot run multiple apps at the same time without 1 or more app crashing completely. Want to use spotify while you also have maps going on a drive? Nope, the phone closes 1 or the other because it can't handle both apps at once. Want to have maps running in the background? Nope, not with this phone. If you exit out and let it go in the background, it simply closes your map and directions. Want to show a friend something on youtube or send a snap with a cute filter to your significant other? HAHA! Joke's on you nerd! This phone takes a laughably long amount of time to even LOAD snapchat or youtube, and many times half way through a video or through applying some filter/sending a snap it will simply crash the application. This phone is infuriating. I honestly have to fight the urge to throw it across the room into a wall every day. The only upside to this phone is the low price tag, but the low price tag makes sense when you realize you are paying for a piece of trash phone that should be sold for 50 dollars, not even 100. Don't buy this phone. I'm furious with it, and it's only been a few weeks new out of the box. 1;	-0.3	9.8
B075FKVJV3	1	Nokia blew it on this one Hands down this is the worst phone I've ever purchased. This phone is beyond terrible. For starters, you cannot download WhatsApp, tango, and other present day communication apps since the apps will crash the moment you open them. This leaves the phone with just texting and calling, but what makes it worse is that texting isn't fully functional and you cannot attach images, voice notes, nor Gifs for that matter, because the messaging app will crash as well. The phone does not have a stock gallery app, so if you take a picture you'll need to download a gallery app from play in order to view your pictures. I've had the phone for less than a week, and already the charging port is lacking function. This phone is not only terribly programmed, but cheaply made as well. AVOID!!! 1;	-0.6	6.0

B075FKVJV3	1	Please use my review as a warning Please use this as your warning! This phone took forever to transfer information from one phone to the next even having a text savvy person doing it. The keyboard numbers and letters were so small that it was impossible to type in your password because you would always hit another button it took me 12 tries to type in 4 digits. After transferring all my information that I needed to the new phone my memory was full mind you I have a additional storage card. Oh yeah the speed of the phone was like dial-up if you don't know what dial-up is just sit there for 5 minutes and do nothing because just accessing a message or anything on the phone would take forever! The look and quality of the phone felt really good and it looked really nice but other than that it is a piece of garbage!

B075H3VWGN	1	Worst Samsung Phone I have had My wife and I have had Samsung Galaxy S3, S5, and now the S7 phones. The 7 has been the absolute worst. Brand new phones (not refurbished) and my wife and I have had difficulty with both. My phone went into thermal runaway due to the initial updates when we loaded the phone. Just over 30 days after we received the phones, my wife's phone stopped working and would not turn on.

It doesn't work and it was a broken iphone. I didn't know until the week before I traveled in September.

B077ZKKBDB	1	Doesn't connect to wifi or cellular service, buggy. Please DON'T buy this phone. When I first got the phone, everything was fine and in order, with the exception of a few hitches - a frozen screen every now and then, but I wasn't really using it because I hadn't connected to a service provider (AT&T in my case). Problems started as soon I got service on it. At first I thought it was the network, and AT&T probably isn't amazing in this area, but my friends and colleagues with AT&T were able to use their phones in the same places. What I mostly notice is that the phone struggles to connect to the cellular service and also doesn't connect well to the wifi. I have to be standing right next to the wifi router to get good service - while other devices (computer, other cell phones) are able to connect from a few more feet away. Calls, via cellular or internet, are constantly dropped... So while the phone might have decent features (decent camera - though bad videos), it isn't able to do the basic things of a phone - which is make actual calls and texting. The phone also freezes during phone calls and it won't allow me to hang up the phone (been a little awkward sometimes). The phone also has no memory storage. Once all my apps were loaded on it, the phone said it was 80% full. I went on one trip for a week, taking a bunch of photos and the phone's storage was completely filled from it. I'm sending the phone back. It's basically completely worthless. 1;	-0.3	7.3

B0787V183F	1	Lemon of a phone. Absolutely terrible. Absolutely terrible. I understand that this is supposed to be a refurbished device, but it the screen had scratches all over, as well as the casing of the phone having dents and scuffs all around it. This is an Amazon certified phone but honestly it looks like it didn't even go through any inspection at all. As if the cosmetic issue wasn't enough, the screen itself starting flickering after being on for just TWO days. Even if Amazon offers a 90 day warranty policy, I wouldn't go near one of these devices again. I called customer service and I was given no support other than a refund for the poor quality product. I'm very disappointed with both the product, and what followed afterwards. 1;	-0.6	7.0

B07914FQ4R	1	Avoid at all costs It doesn't receieve text messages and phone calls if 4g is turned on. Turn off 4g and turn on 3g and you won't miss phone calls and text messages anymore.

B079Z792J7	1	Poorly designed: call must be on speaker to hear person on other end & jack doesn't work. I purchased this in Dec. 2018 after reading several rave reviews. It's been a huge disappointment, and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone. The biggest problems are: 1) I can't hear anyone speak on calls unless I put the phone on speaker. 2) phone jack doesn't work. It cuts in and out randomly. I worked in an open office, so I make all calls using the phone jack and obviously can't put all my calls on speaker phone. Other small problems make it an unpleasant phone to use. It just isn't a well planned phone. I could give about ten examples, but to give you an idea...when I'm on a call, the pressure of my ear causes the phone to changes screens suddenly, an app will inadvertently open up, or the phone will mute suddenly. These issues may be caused by user error, (I should have learned to keep the phone motionless next to my ear during calls) but they shouldn't happen so easily. After using the phone for almost three months I should have worked out these kinks, but it continues to be a negative user experience. 1;	-0.6	8.1
B079Z792J7	1	"USELESS POOR QUALITY PHONE \DO NOT BUY THIS USELESS POOR QUALITY PHONE. THIS PHONE SUFFERS NARCOLEPSY! Phone worked for a while, then after a moto automatic update it started going to sleep intermittently. Moto recommended I remove all non essential apps. I did and it didn't help. I updated with Moto drivers and updates once again and the sleeping get getting worse. Now everything is up to date including the android,BUT THE PHONE STILL TAKES ITS NAP RANDOMLY WHENEVER IT CHOOSES. Meanwhile, I am missing important calls while my phone naps......then I hold the power button for the longest time and it wakes up and I hear \""\""HELLOOO MOTOOO\""\"". How I dislike this sound now!\"" 1;"""	-0.4	4.2
B079Z792J7	1	Bluetooth Intermittent One feature that is important to me is Hands Free Bluetooth (BT) connectivity with my car. I've been having trouble with Hands Free since 12/2018, bought the phone 10/2018. At first it was occasional, I thought maybe it was something I was doing wrong, low battery or too far from the car dash. Now I leave the phone charging in my dash. It doesn't connect most of the time now. If I notice before I start driving, I can turn the phone BT off then on and it will connect and work fine. It does the same in all our cars, 2008, 2016 and 2019 model years. I'ts still under warranty, we'll see how that works out. 1;	0.0	1.8
B079Z792J7	1	Issues Running Multiple Apps/Phone Ringer is Spotty. All the setting are correct yet my phone only rings occasionally, I miss calls constantly. In addition I am a ride share driver and this phone is unable to handle multiple apps running together, it constantly has issues and delays. When running these apps my blue tooth cuts in and out during a call making conversation impossible so I had to turn off the blue tooth and I have to handle the phone while driving. This was simply not he case with my iPhone 6. Not happy at all with this phone but I'll have to deal with it. 1;	-0.4	4.3
B079Z792J7	1	DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE--Not even six months in and it's dead There is NO reason this phone should have quit. It was working fine, I went in to my tanning appointment and 20 minutes later it's a paperweight. I have it in a case, with a tempered glass screen protector. It lives in my purse when it's not in my hand, or laying on the car seat for the bluetooth stereo function. It wasn't dropped, it didn't get wet, it was fully charged; and it won't even come on now. 1;	-0.4	3.0
B079Z792J7	1	This is not a upgrade but a let down. This phone is way over due for a software update to pie. Android 8.0 is junk and the notication sounds do not work in half of the apps. I have moto g5 plus 64 gb with android 8.1 and Don not have any problems. Why does g5-plus have 8.1 and not the g6. I am going to trash this phone and go back to my moto g5 plus. This phone is no bigger than the g5-plus. Same size. Motorola is just to slow in getting updates out. It has been almost a year. This is what makes the phone so bad. Think about it. Have been on motorola for years,but now it time to leave. Maybe back to samsung. 1;	-0.2	5.1

I don't get to the home screen at all :(. I'm out of the product return and support windows (1 month and 3 months respectively).

B07CHWMYHP	1	Very disappointed to the phone's performance As a former Motorola engineer, I thought that I should give some support to its products because Motorola was a great company with great products. So after my Samsung Galaxy S7 edge was soaked by the water in the sea, I decided to look for a Motorola phone. I do not need a fancy one, but one with good camera and smooth internet browsing is mostly what I need. So I bought this Moto G6 Plus international version. Two months after the purchase, I was very disappointed to the performance and quality. I should give the review earlier but I had a lot of travels and finally today I decided to write the review. If I could I would give the rating ZERO star. Come on, guys, did you really test the product before you shipped it to the market? Here are some reasons why this phone is bad: 1. Camera is really crappy. ~30% of the time it cannot focus and the photos are blurry. Sometimes it focuses but is easy to lose focus. This makes taking photos really difficult and unclear. Far objects are not clear , as well as close-up. 2. Touchscreen: The touchscreen does not function well!!! It is lag in response. And obviously it is not calibrated or aligned well -- sometimes I use finger to touch one browsing link, the other link far above or below is open. This makes me frustrated because I have to go back doing again. Similarly I touch one app icon but it takes me to another app! 3. Internet browsing is slow and sluggish. My 7 edge was launched ~5 year ago, but it surfs internet smoothly. I assumed that the G6 plus should have faster core and should be at least as fast as a product of ~5 years ago. 4. RF signal is not good. When we travel overseas, in the most cases my phone shows EDGE in data roaming. My wife's iphone still has LTE. We have T-MOBILE family plan and both phones are with T-mobile roaming plan. Do not know if it is antenna design issue or RF system performance issue for this G6 Plus. That is all for this review. I want to support Motorola products but with the performance like this G6 Plus I might get something like iPhone or Samsung phone instead. 1;	-0.2	14.9
B07CHWMYHP	1	Bluetooth car pairing failed Android 9.0 maybe the issue Purchased this because I have the Moto G5 which is a solid phone with excellent battery. Migration of data failed which could be Google's fault but made the experience bad. The phone wouldn't work with one of my cars, it paired and showed up on the car's bluetooth device list but the microphone didn't work. Other users noted this and attributed it to Android 9.0 which isn't on the phone but the phone wants to install immediately (TMobile carrier in my case). The phone otherwise seemed solid but I have to give the total bundle, which is a combination of Lenovo, Google, and TMobile, a very low rating. Beware if you buy this phone and you expect to use it with bluetooth for car, speakers, etc - try those out immediately and maybe avoid the Android upgrade. 1;	-0.3	3.9

If that's the case then I cannot complain that I can't install certain apps that I need/want. I have a Galaxy Watch that it says it's incompatible with and won't allow the Samsung gear app to be install. It would not allow Netflix app to be installed either. I will be returning the phone.

B07FMPVBQR	1	THERE'S CHANCE YOUR PHONE WILL BRICK AFTER A BAD UPDATE. XIAOMI WILL DO NOTHING. Had the phone for 3 months, worked fine UNTIL AN AUTOMATIC FIRMWARE UPDATE BRICKED THE PHONE. Xiaomi pushed a bad update that bricked a lot of people's phone and will do nothing to help anyone who bought their phone from unauthorized sellers (US sellers Amazon, etc.) Xiaomi as a company DOES NOT PROVIDE INTERNATIONAL WARRANTY meaning that they WILL NOT DO ANYTHING unless you bought it in china or from an authorized seller. So unless you've enabled OEM unlock bootloader and USB debugging on your phone beforehand you can't flash the bad update. You'll have do jump hurdles to undo it and sometimes you'll be SOL. SO BE CAREFUL BEFORE BUYING XIAOMI PHONES. YOU MIGHT JUST HAVE A $200 PAPER WEIGHT 1;	-0.5	5.7

Unlike the Motorola, it doesn't come on from every little vibration. The ear speaker and the ring tone is much louder than previous phones. It works fine with my WiFi, and the Bluetooth has no trouble pairing with my Chevy truck and my Panasonic docking station. Other than that it is an Android like my last phone. I backed up my old phone to the cloud and everything downloaded to the new phone. If I run into problems, I'll provide an update. UPDATE: I bought two of these phones in different colors from two vendors. The first phone works fine as a 4G phone as AT&T recognizes the IMEI number. The second phone's IEMI number is not recognized by AT&T, so it is limited to 3G. I can swap SIM cards and the second phone works as 4G. Other sites on the internet recognize the IEMI number correctly. The problem is AT&T's computer system has no way to manually update this information. They would rather sell you one of their phones. I have no problem with these phones other than it may or may not work with AT&T. 1;	0.0	4.0

B07HD2X91Q	1	Please Reconsider Before Purchasing Purchased this phone for personal use as an upgrade from a moto g5. This was by far the worst purchase I've made in the last 5 years of buying unlocked cell phones. The phone is beautiful, but fails to work properly or consistently. I've had this phone since April 26, 2019, and at the beginning of July 2019 I knew it would be time for a new cell phone. The pros: There is only one - it is a beautiful phone The cons: -The phone shuts off in the middle of calls, texts, and emails, even with a fully charged battery -The battery capacity has quickly decreased. In the beginning I was able to use the phone for a day and a half on a single charge. Now, I have to plug in the phone several times per day - The UI freezes several times per week - The phone struggles to maintain accurate information from compatible Nokia bluetooth products including the Withings smart watches. Data is inaccurate and syncing is often delayed This was nothing like the Nokia phones I enjoyed a decade ago. I saved money by using a gift card; yet after this purchase I feel the card would have been better used on something else. I was glad I chose to keep my g5 as a backup, and did not fully transfer work-related software to this phone.

But I've only had reason to notice that because I'm needing to replace the 7.1 I've had for less than a year. All of the specs in the world don't matter if the phone's inability to charge makes it about as valuable as a skinny  glass-coated brick.

B07HD2X91Q	1	Buy this phone at your own risk! I felt compelled to leave this review after my nightmarish experience with Amazon and Nokia to warn future buyers, like yourself. To start, the usb charging port was defective when I first received the phone. It only charged on one side even though usb c cables are supposed to be reversible. Then in less than a year, the phone stopped charging completely. So I contacted Amazon as the warranty was still in effect. They said to call Nokia about it because the one month return period was over. I tried contacting Nokia but none of the costumer service numbers worked. I eventually got a hold of someone through a combination of emails/live chat. It took them 4 days to essentially give me a run around of how the warranty wasn't valid unless I had a US mailing address and they wouldn't fix it even when I offered to pay for my own shipping >=\ Given how lacking the customer support has been from Amazon and Nokia, I would strongly recommend against buying this phone. The build quality was non-existent and if you run into issues like me, the help will not be there either. 1;	-0.3	4.4

B07HD2X91Q	1	Not what I expected I hate to give 1star reviews especially on something I felt I made a good decision on.Anyway I've always been a fan of Nokia phones. I still have an N8 today that is working fine. When I was looking for a new phone under $400 to replace my aging Huawei 5x I thought this will be a good fit since it had decent specs and camera running pure Android. Well for the pros: this phone feels nice like a premium handset, the screen is very clear and bright, battery lasts a long time. Cons: fingerprint reader works when it feels to, performance is sluggish at times, camera is a bit slow. The biggest con is that you cannot use a micro SD as internal storage only as an external. This is a huge deal breaker for me. Wish I had known this before buying this phone. I am stuck with it now. I really hope Nokia resolves this in an update. Will update review if they do. Edit: Sept 11 2019 Fingerprint reader stopped working in just 6months. I'm very disappointed in this phone. Being a nokia fan, I was really hoping for a good product. 1;	0.0	4.8
B07HD2X91Q	1	It makes me sick to write this... I hate that I'm writing this. I've had nothing but Nokia phones since 1998. They have been fantastic. Until now. I've had the phone for 5 months. I expected the same fantastic product that I have had for years; this has been an utter disappointment. Dropped calls, loss of signal, needing to reboot to make calls, dumped apps...on and on. And Nokia's idea of customer support is a joke now. It used to be second to none. I loathe Apple. However, given what has happened now with my Nokia and the total lack of customer support...I'm facing the reality of dumping the Nokia for..an iPhone. 1;	-0.2	5.6

When I activated the phone everything seemed to work but no matter what I did I had zero cell service and my identical personal phone had full strength. It turns out this phone was sold without disclosing that it was a European market only phone which does not receive the even number LTE bands such as 2, 4, 8, it can pick up some limited LTE on one band and G2 service.

Even after doing countless software repairs and factory resets, my phone kept having the same issues- meaning that it's something to do with a faulty part! Power to those who actually got working phones, but I tried to get this repaired via Sony's customer support center and they wouldn't believe that their hardware was malfunctioning for over a week. I would have wanted to get this phone repaired rather than returning it to Amazon so that I wouldn't have to bet on another faulty phone, but they took over 5 days in order to even consider that my phone was eligible for a repair.

Cloned mobiles, and this lite is slower (regardless of processor spec) & the battery doesn't last anywhere near as long as the Mate 9... Apps open slower & have lag. The screen is absolutely terrible. Screen is black and cannot read at all while wearing my prescription sunglasses (due to polarization I believe) even indoors at max brightness. I thought it might be a bad screen protector, so I removed it & still no luck. It's lighter, and looks & feels cheap. They don't use gorilla glass on these lower models, I already dropped it (~3 ft, in spigen case) and screen cracked on edge.

B07KYGHQ1X	1	Very disappointing I dumped this phone after using it for <6 months. Many very annoying flaws: 1. Laggy user interface. For instance, turning WiFi on and off is an adventure. Tap the icon in the tray, nothing happens. Touch it again. Still nothing. Count to three... now it's off. Except it's now on again because I touched it again, thinking I missed the first time. Turns out I didn't, it just buffered up the two touches and executes them in succession. Really? I read some reviews that mentioned lag, but didn't think any Moto phone could be this bad. Shame on me. 2. Laggy keyboard. Typing anything is an adventure. It is possible to get several letters ahead of the phone, at which point it starts dropping letters. Not good. 3. Screen is not very bright. No prayer of seeing anything in the sun. Screen is also not very pleasing to look at, it just doesn't look very good, even when you can see it. 4. Camera leaves a lot to be desired. Slow. Quality is lacking. This was a major mistake at $300. Probably worth half that. 1;	-0.3	12.5

For some reason, the device came on one SIM-card, whereas the description doesn’t say anything and there is no information, so by default all Samsung come with lots on two SIM-cards. My task in choosing this device was precisely in this, so that I had an expensive flagship with a large functional channel, and I had two SIM cards. Now it's just a piece of expensive iron. If there are solutions on this issue, tell me? If not, then I will have to go to the consumer rights society through lawsuits and thereby return the money spent to empty.

B07NNVLH1D	1	Not recieving calls This review has been edited: Original: The first thing I would like to say is that the shipping was phenomenal. I was told it was going to take a week to two weeks to get here and it only took a few days! It was so easy to transfer all my files from my previous Galaxy to my new one. I have T-Mobile for a carrier and it was all too easy to switch my service all by myself from my old phone to my new phone. The charging speeds compared to my ancient old phone is mind-blowing. I originally had the Galaxy on5 and now I have the Galaxy A50. The processing speeds are so amazing. I did not realize how slow my old phone was until I got this one. I absolutely love the cameras! I can use the cameras in the dark and still get a visible picture! I could never do that with my old phone! The image quality is a hundred times better than my old phone. So far I have had this phone for 2 days so if anything changes I will adjust my review but so far everything is amazing! This phone did come with a phone case and a 64 gigabyte memory card. The phone case is rather thin but for a free phone case I cannot complain. I do recommend purchasing a sturdier phone case to protect this amazing phone. So far I am extremely satisfied with this purchase! Such a great deal! Edited: I am not receiving calls. I took my phone to Tmobile to switch out my SIM card and for the first day it seemed to have worked. Unfortunately I am still not recieving all my calls so its leading to unnecessary arguments with loved ones. I regret buying this phone. I should have purchased a phone directly from Tmobile. 1;	0.2	12.5

B07NQGV37P	1	Everything works fine except the microphone I bought this phone because it was cheap with the expectation that it would not to be that great but that it would work better than expected. The phone works decently well for everything except the microphone. The connectivity is a little worse than my 4.5 year old iPhone. The battery does last a long time too at first. I make very few calls, and my mother was the only complaining about the sound quality. I did a little test where I placed the phone on a table and I didn't think it was that bad. However, after making an important phone call to my doctor who could not understand me at all I decided to do a little more testing. I tested the microphone while actually holding the phone it seems that any gentle touch or movement along the back part of the phone gets amplified a 1000-fold and makes it nearly impossible to discern what someone is saying. The call quality is also good over blue tooth suggesting it's not a reception issue but actually the microphone. The issues also persists with and without 2 phone cases. Because I waited more than 30 days, the seller will not take the phone back. 1;	0.0	7.2

B07NYBD9DW	1	Very disappointing I dumped this phone after using it for <6 months. Many very annoying flaws: 1. Laggy user interface. For instance, turning WiFi on and off is an adventure. Tap the icon in the tray, nothing happens. Touch it again. Still nothing. Count to three... now it's off. Except it's now on again because I touched it again, thinking I missed the first time. Turns out I didn't, it just buffered up the two touches and executes them in succession. Really? I read some reviews that mentioned lag, but didn't think any Moto phone could be this bad. Shame on me. 2. Laggy keyboard. Typing anything is an adventure. It is possible to get several letters ahead of the phone, at which point it starts dropping letters. Not good. 3. Screen is not very bright. No prayer of seeing anything in the sun. Screen is also not very pleasing to look at, it just doesn't look very good, even when you can see it. 4. Camera leaves a lot to be desired. Slow. Quality is lacking. This was a major mistake at $300. Probably worth half that. 1;	-0.3	12.5

This phone constantly drops calls and I'm on the same network I had before. I have no service in places i had full service with my galaxy s6. I'm going to have to buy a GPS because it constantly loses signal and never picks it back up. Also my texts dont go through sometimes so I'm having to resend texts then he person gets them twice. It's not my network my daughter has a TCl cheap phone and she gets better service in the same room as me. So yeah it has great battery and the screen is big and clear but I need a phone and more importantly a GPS FOR WORK. Wish I would have sent it back before the window closed for returns. 1;	-0.3	4.8
B07Q84DPZH	1	beautiful phone......wrong language You will probably regret asking my opinion but here goes.....purchased this phone on line including an nice otterbox to match. Got the phone and everything was in spanish, mexican or whatever. I called Amazon, spoke with a rep, we laughed about it and she asked if I wanted to exchange it. I said yes , for an E.NGLISH speaking one. She said no problem. Received the new phone a couple of days later. Low and behold! Another spanish speaking phone. Couldn't even understand the instructions. I was fairly livid at this point. Had to mail both phones and otterbox back and wait for refunds.

I do not care for the windows functions as I am used to navigating Android apps - but I guess I knew that how it came. Now the worse part, we put a MICRO (did not pay attention that I needed that) SIM card into the phone and my carrier has activated it. The phone got so HOT in 5 min. on that I could not even hold it, not to mention to think about putting it close to my face. When we are being warned about cell phone radiation this phone should be a poster child for that predicament. Sorry but not recommend this for anyone alive. 1;	-0.1	4.0
B00B2BYU1Q	2	Lumia 920 from TABLET DISTRIBUTORS I am extremely dissapointed and would not suggest this seller to anyone. The phone came not in the original packaging, it has had it's screen changed, so at&t logo wouldn't show up. There is a missing bolt on the bottom (only an empty slot left, where on the other side it's ok). The screen protector is on, but it has been changed and is not the original one, because I kno how lumia phones come when they are new. All the side stickers have been removed and there are scratches on the sim slot, because it probably has been used. There is a scratch on the back of the phone as well. AND it doesn't even turn on, is just stuck on the empty battery screen. I'm just very mad right now. Exchanging it. 1;	-0.3	4.2

B00B2BYU1Q	2	The item appears not new I bought this as a gift to my daughter in India. It was sent through my friend in January 2014 to India . I did not open the package . On using the Mobile by my daughter it started to become unusually hot ,. She took it to Nokia Care in India, on opening the mobile to check the technician found the seal tampered and said it must be a refurbished phone. The software it appears is also outdated. Can you help me with a replacement. I can ask my daughter to return it to me. I stay in Chicago, Illionois. This is the first time I have faced a problem purchasing through Amazon. I have bought many items and had never faced any problems. 1;	0.0	3.3
B00B2BYU1Q	2	Be careful when buying this product. Lumia 920 RM-821 is a UK phone. Yes it matters M$ made it matter. Constant errors and no warranty support since its an older model. RM-821 was not meant to be sold in the US. Also most of the phones with that RM are refurbished. Meaning things like the Sim tray and memory can be from a 821 red phone and installed in a black phone. The Microsoft store had a good laugh when they looked at my phone. They said get the newer model or pay them to reset the phone and load the software. IT'S A NEW PHONE. Im done with Microsoft. Motto-X here i come. 1;	-0.1	3.2
B00B2BYU1Q	2	Only a half-baked blank, not a real finished product I was expecting that company with the name in mobile business will treat its flagship product with proper attention. Especially when the sales are poor and company loses money every month. I was wrong. Not only the OS is half-baked, no useful programs, no maps of my region, no even descent music player. In addition, the phone reboots itself for no reason, 2-3 times a day, no matter what I do. That is super-annoying. Having said that, I admit that I like the overall idea of WP8, but honestly, implementation is horrible. To whom I would recommend this? I dont know, maybe to my family's enemy or to some crazy microsoft lover/Nokia geek, so he/she could spend days and nights setting up and rebooting this useless piece of hardware... I dont know. Seriously, with all this hype around Windows Phone platform, and how it is so much better then other competitors - why is the flagship hardware, backed by 2 super corporations, is so buggy, unreliable, useless? How come? 1;	-0.5	6.9
B00B6SFDHK	2	The product description said this was a NEW phone. ... The product description said this was a NEW phone. When I received it, however, it was obviously a reconditioned phone. The input jack for the charger was scratched and worn from being plugged and unplugged, and the corners on the phone were obviously worn and some of the finish was even worn off. After using the phone for 2 weeks, the battery will not hold a charge for longer than 12 hours with only minimal use, there are dead spots in the touch screen, and the system is slower than my old 8 GB Moto G. I am a big fan of Motorola phones and am hoping that the problems with this one are just related to this individual - obviously pre-owned - phone and not germane to this particular model. I am currently waiting for response from Mobility, Inc regarding either replacement with a phone that IS new, or a refund. ADDENDUM TO ABOVE COMMENT: Mobility, Inc was very prompt and accommodating in responding to my issue. While I did have problems with the product I received, they have done all they can to make it right. 1;	0.0	2.9
B00B6SFDHK	2	Unlocked GSM for foreign carriers only! Will only work with Verizon in the US!!! I liked this phone a lot when I first got it. I thought it would be a similar size, but more powerful, than my older Motorola RAZR Model: XT907. It was a bit bigger all around and this was uncomfortable for me at first. The XT907 is the perfect size phone IMHO and I dislike how large phones have gotten. About two months into owning the phone the power button lost it's ability to press properly. I would have to plug my phone in or hard press the power button, usually against the table, to get the lock screen to show. When I took it to a phone repair shop at the mall they told me it would be cheaper to buy a new phone than to fix the power button since the entire phone would need to be taken apart and that risks damaging internal components. I of course did not want to buy a new phone so searched for a fix online. I found a guide on the website ifixit which you should be able to search for. I purchased a Motorola repair kit on Amazon and spent an hour doing this being very careful. Turns out the metal part we are used to touching on the phone is solid. The real button is attached to the volume/power cable and is a small black circle that provides a cushion for the button to compress. To me, it feels very much like the sensation of pressing a small Snapple cap when it has been removed from the bottle. A small slice off an eraser, some Krazy Glue, and a little patience and my phone was put back together with a working power button for about $8. The only issues with performing this fix were 1. the battery is quite flexible and is easily bent AND 2. the phone has an adhesive on the back of the battery and the housing which keeps the housing and screen snug, but once apart this adhesive won't bond properly and there will be a space where the back of the phone attaches to the main housing. I tried to fix this with some command strips - the ones to stick things to walls without damaging them - but the phone gets hot when in use or charging and I think it affects the ability of the command strips to stay stuck. Regardless, hopefully that was an issue with just my phone. The real problem and why I'm giving this phone 2 stars is because it claims to be a world or unlocked phone. It is a Verizon brand phone and Verizon uses a signal known as CDMA. Most other US carriers and overseas carriers use a signal known as GSM. Now I used this phone overseas with a T-mobile sim card bought in the Czech Republic and the phone worked fine, HOWEVER, when I decided months later to switch carriers in the US from Verizon to T-Mobile the phone would not recognize the sim card. I tried phone repair shops, calling Verizon to unlock the phone, calling Motorola, searching the XDA forums where the techies and phone geeks hang out - all to no avail. Now I did find a tutorial for unlocking this very model phone on YouTube, but it involves downloading some software which didn't work for me. Maybe someone with more technical ability could figure it out, but I ended up having to purchase a new phone at a Best Buy that I was sure would work on all domestic carriers. Honestly, this phone is in purgatory for me. Not only did it have a manufacturer issue of the power button failing, but it also isn't truly an unlocked world phone as it is described if it doesn't work on all carriers in the US. That on top of it having an okay camera and storage capacity compared to phones out on the market today make this an iffy purchase. If you are going to stick with Verizon, don't care about storing too much on the phone, and like a small-ish phone compared to the monsters that exist today. Then, yes, this is a solid phone. I can't recommend it based on my experiences. Very frustrating overall. 1;	-0.1	16.9

B00E6FGSHY	2	Overwhelmed by Touchwiz This phone really should be a five star product in most nearly every aspect. It has a removable battery and expandable storage for a mini micro SD card. The five inch super amoled screen is quite lovely. It's lightweight and the size of the device is very manageable even with the Trident Aegis case I'm using with it. Call quality is certainly better than on my iphone 5s. What's the problem then? Well, it's actually a pretty big one for me. In fact, it's a deal breaker! This phone constantly lags and even freezes at times. Sometimes, it requires restarting the device. I have to constantly go in to settings to clear out the ram. The Touch Wiz UI simply overwhelms the internals despite the 2 Gigs of ram. (Prior to this device, I owned a Galaxy Note 2 which worked much more seamlessly despite being a prior generation device.) I wish I had purchased the Note 3 instead. I suspect it can much better handle the Touchwiz user interface due to its 3 gigs of ram. Also, I miss have the larger phablet sized screen. So, I can not recommend the S4 despite liking so much about the phone. However, these lagging/freezing issues could possibly be alleviated somewhat when the kit kat update becomes available. But, that's probably more wishful thinking than anything else! Oh, there's one feature that truly annoys me which is S voice. I went into settings and deactivated it altogether. It seems redundant when Google voice is so superior. If you can manage with a costlier and larger device, you may want to consider the Note 3. I base that on my experience with the Note 2 and the positive things that I've discovered about the similar S4. I also own an Iphone 5s which I do like a great deal. However, the 4 inch screen is simply too small for my comfort. My wife also has an Iphone and is quite delighted with hers. But, once again, the Samsung Galaxy S4 is a no go for me because of the lagging and freezing issues caused by Touchwiz! -Charlie 1;	0.0	13.5

It took 4 different attempts to find a technical service person who answered the call, made an obvious assessment, and initiated the replacement process. On two of the attempts we were on hold for one hour (personal upper limit), then 35 minutes, before hanging up. On the fourth call, the following day, we were connected with the most effective VZW call center person I have ever spoken with. As a ten year VZW customer, who has generally experienced good customer service, this ranks as the worst experience, ever.

Samsung would not warranty this as it was refurbished and the seller only offers a 30 day warranty which expired last week. Have not tried moving files via the usb port but assume that is broken as well. I have had HTC and LG phones and they have held up for the most part during the two year contracts I have had over the last 4 years. Buyer beware. 1;	-0.3	4.0

B00KM10ITK	2	Lumia 635 512MB T-Mobile Version I ordered this based off a questions answered said it was definitely upgradeable to Windows 10, it's not. The Lumia 635 1GB is upgradeable, the 512MB isn't. I already own a 635 512MB and didn't need another. I also ordered the black model but received the white one instead. It upgraded to Windows 8.1 with no problem and took a few hours to install my current backup to mirror my other 635 phone. It accepted my external memory chip without a problem. The reason I rated it so low is because I needed the 1GB version to upgrade to Windows 10 due to I need a GSM phone for use overseas when I go on deployment next week. I don't have the time to return due to my deployment schedule and it already has all my information on it. I was able to find a Lumia 640XL GSM 2GB Windows 8/8.1 here on Amazon and I checked with Microsoft and it is upgradeable to Windows 10 without a problem. I paid dearly for one-day shipping so I can get it two days before I go on deployment. Had this been upgradeable to Windows 10 then I would've easily given this 5 stars because it's a great Phone that does everything you need it to do but with Microsoft not supporting Windows 8/8.1 anymore I can't afford the risk to use it. 1;	0.0	2.7

B00LAEA8E8	2	Glitchy I rarely leave a poor review but I've had this phone for a few weeks now and it has been very glitchy. I have the same service provider I did before. This phone is an upgrade from what I had. It drops calls and my call quality is poor. I am now starting to have issues with notifications for email, texts and other things not coming through. I'm not sure what this phone went through before but something is wrong with it. I'm strongly considering returning it. It may not be the latest and greatest but it should work better than my old 3G phone. 1;	-0.3	4.3
B00LAEA8E8	2	Disappointed I upgraded from Galaxy S4 to Galaxy S5. I now wish I had stayed with the S4 or had looked at the S6. Really do not like the wider power/data cable. Also could do without the little power cord door - just something else to break and now an extra step every time you charge or disconnect. The phone itself is constantly reverting to 3G. Internet response time is horrible now. I also have had dropped calls while speaking and voicemail notifications without having any phone call logged. This never happened on the S4. I usually keep phones a long time but I'm sure I will get sick of this one quickly. The company I purchased the phone delivered quickly - ordered on Friday and it was delivered on Monday. I would definitely purchase from them again, but next time I will do a lot more research and try to see it in person before I purchase. 1;	-0.2	4.9

B00N532DU4	2	Good for a quick fix, not for long term use I have to admit that I went from a V10 to the Mega 2 due to loosing mine in a mud hole on Christmas Eve. I ordered this one out of desperation coupled witht the fact that I did not want to draw out a stupid 29 or 30 bucks extra on my cell phone bill for a new phone which mine was paid for in full when I bought it. I am not thrilled with it this phone at all. For starters, I am used to not having any of the buttons on the side and now that I do I am constantly turning the ringer off. Additionally, the screen often freezes up to the point I have to take the battery out of it in order to shut it down. Furthermore, I do not like that there is not an available Defender type cell cover for it and the battery does not last long at all. Again, I bought it on the fly, but now that the price dropped for the V10 I have ordered a new one. It will be here by Wednesday...thank goodness. 1;	-0.3	5.0

B00NACK1DG	2	The Mega should be obsoleted. Currently on Amazon there are quite a few cell phones selling for $100.00's of dollars when in actuality those phones should be obsoleted. At the very least - under $100.00. In a nutshell - due to the age of this 'new' phone - the operating system is years past. The camera is years past. There are quite a few current Apps not available in the Mega App store. I would recommend this phone for a small child - not an adult.

I've had another Galaxy S5 Active before and did not have any problems with it. When I got this phone the first thing I noticed was that the charge port cover didn't close all the way. I bought this phone because of its water resistance.... but what ever, I shrugged it off. Then after two weeks I noticed that the camera cover was completely full of pocket lint along with the front camera. I had my other Galaxy S5 Active for like 6 months. It was a tank. I was carrying this one in my pocket and the screen cracked. I know it says that its refurbished, but I didn't know that that meant that they used the cheapest parts possible and that it would pretty much negate the whole point of getting the Active version of the S5.

They have no apps of which are useful to everyday life, and Facebook Messenger isn't even supported on it and the Facebook app was horrible. The internet capabilities are less than subpart. The tabs take long to load and don't always load right so you have to refresh a lot. It's a good price for basic texting and talking and the only perk of a Windows phone is that you can connect to your windows computer. Sharing files and pictures between the two.

B00OZTSY6Y	2	Disappointing, glitchy, unreliable. I have to say this phone has been a big disappointment. We have had Moto X phones before with good experiences and I expected a next-generation experience from that. The specs are all there, and the phone is attractive enough. Setup and personalization are OK. However, the phone immediately had some issues related to the vendor software: switching to speaker mode during a call worked, but could not be switched back to headset. Very annoying. Volume control during media playback seems to randomly affect ringtone levels instead. Pairing with vehicle systems (2 different manufacturers) is inconsistent and track data is not transmitted (apparently due to the lack of an enhanced AVRCP driver, something the Moto X had 2 years ago). More recently the phone began becoming very hot, seemingly at random but often when the charge level was low. Last week, after less than 3 months of use, it heated up again and the touchscreen stopped responding. After a reboot, the screen seems totally blank. Phone has gone back to Moto for a replacement, we will see how that process goes. Maybe I got a lemon, but at least 2 other folks at work with the same phone have also had issues. 1;	-0.3	8.9

B00YW7L830	2	So what started as a great experience, ended with this company trying to get ... At first I was so excited about my phone! It had a 90-day warranty and it seemed to work really well. About a week or so into having it, I noticed that it started glitching out, whenever I would try to text it would click a letter up to 5 times, and wouldn't let me backspace. Also, it was having a hard time when I would try to zoom in and out. It would be all shaky. So I contacted Electronic Deals, and they were more than helpful. They told me to try and factory reset it and go from there. Which I did, but to no avail. But I had to keep it for a while because that was my only line of communication until I could find a replacement phone interim. So, once I was able to get a different phone and transfer my information over, I sent it back with a letter that was explaining what it was doing also, the tracking number. Well, I received an e-mail from them that said they had received it and provided me with a tracking number, and then a couple days later (today) they told me that they could not offer me an exchange or a refund because I had it for three months. (But within my 90 days.) I then replied that it was within the 90 days and I asked what was wrong with it. Considering that I sent it back with a screen protector, a case, and took the battery out, as well as bubble wrapped it. They were unable to give me an answer for what was wrong and proceeded to tell me that the warranty was with Samsung and not them. However, I have the warranty card that tells me that it was through them. So what started as a great experience, ended with this company trying to get out of honoring their warranty. And I am out $200.00. 1;	0.0	8.8
B00YW7L830	2	Let down. I was excited to have found such a good deal on a refurbished phone. I was even more excited when it came and it looked better than I expected. That is until I tried to use the camera. I like to take pictures of my fur babies and to not have the flash on the camera work was unfortunately inconvenient. A small thing to be put off by, but it's an issue that's important for me. The return process was easy so I'll try them again. Maybe it was just a fluke. We'll see... 1;	0.0	3.2

The one and only reason to buy this phone is for the camera which is exceptional. Yes, it'd fast but there are plenty of other high end phones that blown this out of the water including the OnePlus Three that can basically be had for 3/4 the price. I reverted back to my Nexus 6P. That said, I've heard better things about the S7 edge and Note 7 but the note costs about 800 on contract and that is just absurd. Buy the 5x while the eBay sale is going on.

It wasn't exciting, but it was sturdy, dependable, and nearly indestructible. I had high hopes for this generation, but it was not to be. If the Moto G was a gruff, no-nonsense warrior king, the Moto G4 is what you get from royalty after several generations of unchecked inbreeding. Physically, the phone feels fairly well constructed, if noticeably lighter. The light plastic back has a habit of popping off occasionally, but it's not too bad. I seriously hate that it's too big to easily hold in one hand, but I guess that's what phones are doing these days. The integrated ads weren't annoying at all. The camera is better than I'm used to.

B01FJT7E0A	2	Mediocre Phone In researching this phone, it seemed like it should take awesome pictures and have really good battery life. I can't even make it through an entire day without charging this phone at least twice. The whole reason I replaced my old phone was because I was having to charge it multiple times throughout the day. Even with all alerts turned off and automatic updates turned off, the battery life is still poor. I even set my AVG to stop apps from running in order to save battery life. It still sucks. Photo quality is poor. Images are not sharp and everything has a slight blur as though I'm shaking while taking pictures (I have very steady hands, I make custom jewelry and often work with tiny tools and small pieces, if my hands weren't steady, I wouldn't be able to make such items). The speaker on this is abysmal. There are a few good things about this: it's super easy to transfer stuff from your old phone to this one using a special Xperia app. I was able to keep all my music, pictures, videos, apps, etc... There is no lag when texting, scrolling, using the internet, or using apps. It took my SIM and SD cards with no problems. The phone is fairly easy to navigate. I still think I paid too much for it. It's an outdated phone with poor audio and photo capabilities. I am not an expert in cellphones. I am just comparing this phone to my old HTC M8 One that I got in 2014 (which had great photo and audio capabilities). Paying about $50 for this would be more reasonable. 1;	0.0	11.1

So, it has a great camera and screen resolution. Plus, a huge screen that I'm a fan of myself. These are the ONLY reasons I'm giving it two stars. The specs are okay, but the the issue is the updates are decently large and frequent. (I've gotten three updates in the last month and a half or so.) With the frequent updates, I find myself reluctant to update as much to conserve data, but the issue is now I'm getting the \""\""process has stopped\""\"" error and sometimes it doesn't go away or let me choose to shut down the system or wait to fix so your phone gets stuck there with no way to get off.

As with many Sony products I have had the volume with headphones is low for me. I obviosly don't have the best hearing but music and videos were low enough that I had to drag a old galaxy phone around just so it can act as my music player. On top of all of that the phone has terrible third party support. Don't bother with any of the screen protectors they have on Amazon, I tried three of the \""\""best\""\"" and they were really bad. They didn't stick well and none covered the whole screen (despited all of them saying it did). I also ordered a few cases and the best one was only meh..

If I hadn't of run out of internal memory (which apps run off of - so having a memory card in it doesn't solve the issue), I would have just continued with my old phone - but since I had to upgrade, I really was hoping that the very frustrating issue with texting would have been solved for this phone - but alas, no.

Of course, there is no way to back up the data in the phone, which is much more important than this phone. Sony customer service said the data will be removed before repair - standard rule of repair. And I asked them to send me the parts, I repair it myself. They refused. Then it means warranty of 12 months is worthless. Maybe that's why Sony is unable to expand their cell phone market share, to compete with Apple and Samsung in the US.

B01LEL8ABY	2	1440p Res, AMOLED Screen, Crappy Battery, Cool phone mods I am immensely disappointed this phone couldn't last me a year before the phone's battery started showing symptoms of a dying battery. I remember when overcharging was a thing and i bulged my iphone 2's battery. Though i don't know for sure its probably not from overcharge but overheating that stressed the battery and ultimately caused it to have extremely poor readings on the status, battery life and reliability. I specifically chose this phone because it was in a price range i liked and the concept of having mods on it was very cool to me, that and the specifications of the phone itself compared to the other high end phones at the time. I'd planned to use this phone to play games like i used to on my Nexus 2 but i wanted better performance because it'd lag very often on the Nexus 2. The phone performed pretty well on phone games with heavy visual effects and emulators such as playstation 1, but it didn't do very well on Gamecube Dolphin emulation. My issues with the phone are its seemingly extreme overheating, the fact that mod's don't really work with cases and the poor battery capacity. It overheats very easily when i play games and cant really tolerate it too long, not very good if you play phone games where you farm for long periods. It was noticeably hotter then my Nexus in my opinion, i kind of suspect if you put a case on it makes it overheat more but i don't know too much about that. Mods are cool but they are pretty expensive, and they probably don't work with a case. But then again i haven't tried. Battery life really sucks, and it will suck for heavy users because the screen looks best at max brightness which consumes a crapton of power. As for my battery issue i tried to contact Motorola about a repair, but they give you textbook answers and solutions before they seem to agree to let you repair it. Things like power cycling (restarting), safe mode and what not. They do follow up with an email and reminder to schedule a repair after the phone call however to their credit. I would not buy this phone again. 1;	-0.2	8.0

I love the features and all that as it reminds me of a mini computer...However it has only been 10 months since I have been using this phone and now the sensor on the right side of the touch screen is not working. I cannot change my camera from front to back. If I am watching a youtube video I cannot watch it on full screen. If I want to share a message someone sends me via whatsapp I cannot forward it to no other person. In order for me to make whatsapp calls I have to go into my contacts and select the method of calling there. I cannot call anyone via whatsapp if I am already in whatsapp messaging someone and then decides to call them. This phone is beginning to give much stress than I expected for less than a year.

B06X9HVVC5	2	"Good looks but disappointing performance \I have been an iPhone user for last 10 years and decided to try an Android device because I am beginning to dislike the \""\""look\""\"" of an Apple phone. So I went with this budget phone from Sony. Read extensive reviews and all the reviews seemed to say that in this price range this is a nice phone to have. But unfortunately I am extremely disappointed with the performance of the phone. The phone itself looks good. But I am not sure why they have such extended bezels. The length of the phone could easily have been reduced by 0.5 inches without affecting screen size. The camera is very bad in night shots/indoor lighting. The images are distorted. Normal daytime pictures are alright. The response of the touch screen is not reliable. I am already having problems with upper portion of screen where the touch is not responsive. Simple things like connecting to a tele-conf line where you have dial multiple numbers in a sequence is difficult because the response of the number button is slow. All in all a very disappointing experience. I have been a fan of Sony products but did not expect this inferior product.

B06XRJQX91	2	Battery came to me at 70% I bought this phone as an upgrade to my old iPhone. I do like the larger screen and the better camera, however there are some major problems that overshadow that and make me wish I went with a droid. My battery came to me at 70%. That’s pretty low. The first few days with my phone I was shocked that the battery life was even worse than my 5s by a long shot. I spend part of my day thinking about where I’m going to charge my phone next. I went to a concert with 90% battery and mid concert after 2 photos I noticed my phone was at 11%. Figured I’d turn it off to use for emergencies and a taxi later. Nope. My phone decharged itself entirely and refused to turn back on. Yesterday evening my phone also decharged itself while I slept on the charger. Good thing I didn’t have to be up early yesterday.

B06XRJQX91	2	Bad battery I’m happy with the way the phone looks but upon opening it, it shows it only has 88% battery lifespan.

B06Y16RL4W	2	It is a nice phone and works well It is a nice phone and works well. I have been using it for about 4 months and have not had any problems with how fast the phone operates or any software glitches that are game breaking. However, I do not use the bixby button and it is annoying since my old phone's unlock button is now where that button is located. Also, when utilizing the phone and accidentally touching the curved edges you get little popups in the corners that are also really annoying. And lastly the curved edges make it extremely hard to protect the phone's screen. This is due to not having a phone case that protects those edges of the phone. I much prefer a flat screen. I did not think this would be a huge deal breaker when I purchased the phone but after dropping it twice, with a case on it, I have received two cracks in the screen. One crack for each drop. I will probably end up replacing the screen and trying to make due with the issue, but I am not happy with samsung over this phone and looking a bit harder in the future at other phone manufacturers. 1;	0.0	5.2

B071JP8XDJ	2	Poor support from Sony and cannot use AT&T Mobile Security / Call Protect Overall - I must say that I like the phone. It has done everything I bought it for well. BUT, here is why I have decided to write a review and to take three stars off the rating. I have been having issues with telemarketer/scammers calling my phone with bogus caller ID phone numbers. Many of them are disconnected numbers - but the more annoying ones are listing a local valid phone number - that is actually owned by actual local people or businesses – so you cannot block them without blocking people/businesses that are legit. So, I called AT&T about anything they could do and they told me to install AT&T Mobile Security and Call Protect – that this would help block these calls. I installed the AT&T Mobile Security App (which is maybe already bundled with Call Protect – not sure – odd wording). But I got an error during the install saying “Not Eligible – Your device must be enabled with AT&T HD-Voice to use this service”. So, I spent a while looking around on the internet and basically found that HD-Voice and Voice Over LTE is the same thing. It allows the voice portion of the call to go over LTE and data to still be usable while the voice call is in progress. I assume this is needed so their app can be receiving the call and checking against their app database system simultaneously to decide whether to allow or reject the call. I found YouTube videos of people with other brands of phones running Android that were able to go into Settings and enable the feature. But I couldn’t find the setting in my phone – different menu structure from the videos. I contacted Sony to see where they located this setting on their phone. To make the story short – two of their “support” reps confirmed that this phone (based on model and IMEI) supports HD-Voice. They then proceeded to give me instructions for how to configure the phone for some headset that I don’t have, nor do I have any headset, and that was their “solution” to my problem!?! I re-explained and told them that this is also known as Voice Over LTE (VOLTE) and that seemed to turn on a lightbulb in one of the rep’s head. At this point I was not confident at all that either of them had a clue about what I was actually talking about – but what else could I tell them! I explained all the steps I took – the apps involved, the exact error message!?! It was quite apparent that they had no idea what I was talking about and/or didn’t clearly read the issue and/or were simply setting there searching a support database with no inherent knowledge of this issue. In both cases I asked for a supervisor or more senior support tech – and in both cases they said no one else was available and they were it!!! Really Sony – you’ve got one rep for the USA and one for the UK and neither of them answer to anyone!?!?!?! At this point they both settled on that it was AT&T that would have to turn on the feature and for me to contact AT&T to resolve the issue!!! I re-iterated that I had seen videos of others that were able to turn the feature on/off from the Settings menu on their non-Sony phones and I didn’t understand why only AT&T could turn this feature on/off. By this time, they were talking in circles: It’s AT&T’s fault – call them!!! Back on the phone with AT&T!! Their Advanced Support – twice says – they phone is not HD-Voice capable and that they cannot provision it!?!?! Oh, and maybe I should just do a “free” upgrade and get a new phone. So – which is it? AT&T is pointing the finger at Sony (while trying to sell me a new phone contract) and Sony is pointing the finger at AT&T – probably (in my opinion) just to get me off their support line as they had no clue and wouldn’t spend any more time on the issue. In the end – no solution. I can’t install and run the Apps and most importantly to me at this point – I have no faith in Sony to provide any support on their phones. Yes – I lean towards Sony’s techs being wrong here as they were so oblivious and irrational throughout. 1;	-0.1	11.5
B071JP8XDJ	2	Poor rear camera, and annoying built in software The rear camera is not very good, especially compared to the front camera's. Also the factory installed touch keyboard is really laggy, and keeps prompting me to sign up for an account.

B071P9NHSN	2	Buy a different phone I would not recommend buying this phone. This phone lags all the time. It takes a while to open an app or if you are trying to send a text, sometimes it takes a long time for the keyboard to pop up. I have not used up a lot of my memory so I know that is not why this is happening. Sometimes it shows that I sent a text but it did not actually send or I didn't receive a text from somebody even though I am in a place that has service for sure.

B071ZDQ6MV	2	Nice build quality. Chokes and freezes sometimes. Touchscreen inaccurate! For the $225 I paid for this phone, it's remarkably nice. It is easy as well built as my old Nexus 6p with its $700+ build quality. The screen also looks very nice. It's stock android, no bloatware at all, which is great. It updates to Android 8.1 right away. Software wise, it looks as new as anything from Google. The downsides. The camera is slow and the pictures are often blown out or there's just bad color contrast. It's also slow to take a picture. You have to press the shutter button and wait a half a second or else you'll have blurry pictures. Data connection also seems lame. Whether it's connected to tmobile LTE 4G or wifi, it just gets stuck sometimes and claims no connection. Super annoying. Lastly, about once a day the phone just freezes for 10 seconds or so. It seems to not manage ram well. I only bought it to hold me over until something better comes along. This phone feels nice and looks nice, but I can't wait to replace it. I edited my review down to 2 stars. I hate this phone and can't wait to throw it away. The touchscreen is so inaccurate that I can't login to some websites. When I click login, it presses the 'forgot password' button. I have to try pressing random areas of white space until it hits login...

I really regret that decision because the phone is horrible in every word i got this phone in august of 2017 and I really regret that decision because the phone is horrible in every word. 1. you can take a picture and find out later it was not saved because the app itself takes long time to save the picture and if you close it before that it does not save it 2. messaging app is horrible and doesn't allow either group msgs or sending pics 3. the phone only charges with its own charger or it wont really charge even if you connect it to a laptop. 4. sometimes you save a contact and find out later it only saved the first 2 numbers. 5. it crashes a lot and often is very slow or processing. 6. it feels like the phone is very primitive and is not really worth that much money at all. 7. the music app that comes with it is horrible and you have to use a third party app or something. 8. if the weather is cold and you try to use the phone it starts crashing. 1;	-0.3	7.6
B071ZDQ6MV	2	Poor signal on T-Mobile/MetroPCS network Was only able to ever get 3G in a major city, poor call quality, and barely had any signal in my house on a T-Mobile/MetroPCS network.

B071ZDQ6MV	2	Do not buy this Pros: -cheap $150 -native Android -headphone jack -stereo speakers -microsd card Cons: -super sluggish. Apps (Snapchat, Facebook messenger, venmo, Byrd scooter, Google maps) all lag to an excruciating amount and I constantly get the message that the app is no longer responding and requires it shutting off. I lose recordings and pictures. I pay more in fares because the apps continue to run. Everything about it is sluggish. Bottom Line: spend a little more money like on a Moto 5g. 1;	-0.5	3.2
B071ZDQ6MV	2	Very poor reception with phone if you don't have a strong signal you'll hate this phone Phone is a very big disappointment! It doesn't pick up signal well. Doesn't say connected to WiFi.

The phone isn't worth the money they charge. 1;	-0.4	3.2
B071ZDQ6MV	2	You Get What You Pay For We bought two of these. I came to this phone from a Huawei Honor 8 ($350 Chinese phone) that I dropped in the ocean. Other than the larger screen everything about the Nokia 6 is a big step backwards from my last phone. The camera is bad in low light, very slow, reminds my of my Motorola Droid phone from ~2011. The android experience on this phone feels like when you run Windows 10 on a PC form 2007. Everything is super slow. Battery life is just ok. Got ym wife a Mi Mix 2 last month and just ordered a OnePlus 5T for myself. Planning on selling both of these Nokias on ebay. 1;	-0.1	2.5

B071ZDQ6MV	2	Feels like an knockoff brand phone. Overall, this is a phone which does everything I need it to. However, there are a few glitches and features that are missing that make it feel more like I bought some off-brand phone instead of what I was expecting (and hoping) from Nokia. For instance, several times a day it asks me to select which SIM I'm using (even though I only have one in there), and the google app screen randomly disappeared until I restarted the phone, and then the widgets I had disappeared from the main screen. The intentional lack of LED notification light in the US version is really unfortunate. Although there are third-party apps to install that can simulate it, I'd much rather have the notification light integrated into the phone itself which is what I expect from and want in a modern smart phone. I've also noticed a lot more pop-up ads and such when I'm browsing articles online which take you away from the page you were viewing, but I'm not sure if that's due to the phone or not. If this is a sign of what Nokias are going to be like, I don't think I'll be buying them in the future. I feel like I could have gotten something with similar functionality (albeit maybe with less storage and a worse camera) for half the price. 1;	-0.1	4.4
B071ZN4K8V	2	Beware of certified refurbished - BuySpry rating is going down fast Bottom line: when something is wrong with the device, your warranty may already have expired. So you have 90 days to evaluate all the features, which want's enough time for me. I was initially very excited about the phone, but later started discovering some issues. As time went by I noticed that some features don't work. At this point I am confident that there is an issue with this phone. This is what I am experiencing: 1. Double tap on the screen to wake it almost never worked, so I turned it off. 2. Almost no notifications are getting to my screen when I receive a message/e-mail/hangout etc. I double checked all the settings - the notifications are on for all apps. In addition, I know something is wrong because notifications do sometimes appear on the screen. 3. The blinking light almost never works properly. Most of the time it is not blinking, but when it does, it blinks a few times and goes off, essentially rendering it useless. 4. The vibration intensity is so weak that I almost never feel it in my pocket. Sometimes I can miss a notification when the phone lays on the table (remember that screen doesn't turn on when I receive a message) 5. I have extremely high failure rate when typing on the keyboard - 50% of the time it seems like I miss a correct button. The words suggestions are ridiculous and never fit my need. In addition, it seems as the number of remembered words is limited to 10. Every day I type a word that I have the keyboard to learn the day before and it doesn't remember it anymore. Contacted seller - whops, 90 days have passed, the manufacturer's warranty expired even before I purchased the phone, so I'm on my own now. BuySpry hasn't offered any solutions for the issues, just told me that they are always there for me, but not to help, apparently. Three stars for the phone, one star to the seller. 1;	-0.3	12.5
B071ZN4K8V	2	Scuffs and Scratches It came in generic packaging, nothing of which inspires excitement. The phone had a couple of stickers on the front and back (signifying some work had been done on the phone). The screen was defect free: not even a minor scratch. Maybe it was replaced. The back, on the other hand, had multiple scratches. Worst was were the charging port was. The black metallic paint had come off completely with a radius of approximately 3 to 4 millimeters. This revealed the unprotected aluminum. At least the phone did turn on. I didn't use the phone so I do not know if it was unlocked or carrier locked. I did not see a Verizon app, so I would believe it was factory unlocked. Came with generic wall brick and USB-A to USB-C cable. Not C-to-C as mentioned in the description. Also, the apps mentioned in the description are no longer supported by Google. Overall, it's an OKAY experience. If your expectations are low, you won't be let down. It's basically a used phone, and it shows. 1;	-0.2	6.2
B071ZN4K8V	2	Almost great Phone arrived in lovely condition. Looked pristine in its package, operated well during setup except for its one flaw: sound absolutely didn’t work on it. I understand when testing phones for workability, all the sounds probably get mixed together so working with a silent phone is easier but this phone wasn’t silent because it was muted. I tested it with different applications, through the headphone jack and by attempting to set alarms. Also be aware that when buying through a third party, even exchanges are NOT a thing. You will have to play the send the phone back, order a new one and keep waiting to have a fully functioning device game. 1;	0.0	2.5
B071ZN4K8V	2	The phone was fine, but the refurb was terrible The phone was fine, but the refurb was terrible. Within three days of owning the phone, two hairline cracks developed on the screen. The phone was in a cell phone case the entire time. So the cracks developed after minimal wear-and-tear. Thankfully, Amazon heard my complaint and has issued me a refund (as soon as I return the phone, which will be tomorrow morning). I give this phone 2 stars because the Google Pixel XL is a stellar phone. But the refurb was terrible. I'm thinking it might be worth it to buy a new phone outright. 1;	-0.5	5.0

When received, I powered it on, super excited to see what this phone would be like. I went through the settings, and once I came to connecting my WiFi, the toggle switch would never move over, leaving even the set up impossible to do.

But then I figured if the phone was bad, it would get replaced. As luck would have it (bad luck!), while the phone I received looked fantastic, it did not activate. It would connect to a WiFi network, but not the AT&T network. After they tried for an hour to fix it in an AT&T store, and with the AT&T technical support, they confirmed that while the new SIM provided was indeed working, it would not work on the phone - basically, the phone provided was defective.

By touching this phone you can tell that the parts do not line up properly. I am not sure if they are genuine Samsung parts or that it is simply the fact that some of the parts were not built at the same time or replaced. Like the power cord plug in, it is not smooth and you cant tell if it is in good. Feels like you are forcing it in. The gray sides overlap the display and the back. In fact, when I use the phone, sometimes my hair gets caught between them and gets pulled out. It is almost $300 for this phone. I know it is a lot less than a new S9, but for $300 I would have expected a better finish. 1;	0.0	2.7

This phone worked as intended until just after the warranty expired, then the microphone ceased to function despite not having any physical or liquid damage. During voice calls, the mic pickup is so faint mic that listeners on the other line are unable to hear any voice even if switching to speakerphone. In addition, all recordings made utilizing any app can barely pick up any external sound whatsoever.

Can take minutes for a page to load and sometimes pages just simply won't load at all. Have tried Chrome and Mozilla Firefox with similar results. Secondly, it is virtually impossible to have a phone call without \""\""cheek dialing\""\"" someone else while on your current call. For example  a week or so ago I was trying to talk to my parents but during a 15 minute phone call I accidentally cheek dialed someone else three different times and had to hang up on them and then re-dial my parents.

Upon arrival is was beautiful and high class, everything I expected for the price. Then I realized right away that the curved glass was going to be a problem with screen protectors...HUGE problem like I went through 10+ before I finally got one to set properly. I use screen protectors to protect the screen and to keep it mint for when I resell the phone. Then, the 5G band on this phone was super finicky always dropping to the 2G band. Fine. I dealt with it, these are somewhat minor issues. Then last week my phone dropped from my pocket approximately 12 inches to the ground while I was sitting on a step. You guessed it, the phone screen cracked. Even with a case and screen protector the phone cracked. That is highly disappointing. I have never had a screen crack on any of my previous phones. This phone is super delicate. Don't even get me started on the scratches you can get on the back of the phone. IMO this is a design flaw with Samsung. I shouldn't have to be on pins and needles with my phone especially at this price point. Not ever again will I spend this kind of money on a phone just to have it crack even though I took every precaution to prevent it. Now I have to spend another $200+ to get it fixed.

I had installed a SD card with a few MP3s and was able to sync it to my bluetooth devices with out a problem also was able to take calls through bluetooth. The troubles I had was due to the inability to handle group MMS. The phone was able to send and receive text just fine and even photos to individuals but once you started to send messages in groups it wasn't able to. I would not receive images that were sent to me via a group message also any reply from groups. It would show as a line in the senders thread but no actual message could be read. Then the messages would have to be cleared due to the inability to store any significant number of messages.

I am just lucky that it crapped out when it did because I can still return it for a full refund. Don't risk it, yes the price is good, but it isn't worth the hassle. I'm now on the other side of the world trying to get a phone shipped to me. Absolute Nightmare. 1;	-0.4	4.6

B075MSP5LH	2	Works for the most part... The S7 I received has the following issues: 1. Poor GPS: it has a hard time getting a good enough signal on a clear day. Go inside a building/car, and it's even worse. 2. TERRIBLE BATTERY: If I put it in my pocket and not take it out, it will be at around 20% by the time I go to bed. If you use it for about an hour, you'll have to charge it at some point or you have a dead phone. 3. Something's loose in there. If I lightly shake the phone, something rattles. I doubt that's an intended feature. 4. Compass and Gyroscope act like a person who spent the last 5 minutes spinning in a circle. In other words, they suck. (Related to the rattling sound?) 5. Phone gets hot. It has a bad habit of getting toasty when you do *anything* with it. Sometimes even doing nothing it will heat up to around 80 Fahrenheit. A couple of times it has gone up to 120 on me. This also happens when it's charging, but even hotter. I charge it off a battery pack (remember the terrible battery?), and I always keep the battery pack between my leg and the phone so I don't find myself with a partially cooked thigh. Don't get me wrong, I love this phone. The Galaxy S7 was in my opinion the peak of Samsung phone development. But this seller clearly doesn't bother to really refurbish their devices before reselling them. 1;	-0.1	9.4

Battery life was really great and the screen used to get so bright. I installed the Pie update and battery life is noticeably worse and the max screen brightness sucks so much now. The fingerprint sensor also malfunctions almost every other time, again this is after the pie update. Other than that it's a good phone. 1;	0.1	4.7

B078JR6L2S	2	It is not refurbished. It is used in bad condition Refurbished typically means it is in great condition and with no defects. But this product should just be sold as used and condition should be described for each phone sold instead of a generic description that it may show some wear. In my case, screen of the phone has 100s of scratches and you can tell it was dropped as it had a ding in the corner. I gave it to someone outside of country, otherwise I would have returned it.

B078T2T2FL	2	Horrible camera for people who are darker or tan! Seems to be a very well built phone, loads of great features, but I bought this phone for the camera, it could be great but something is missing..I'm a tan asian but whenever I take a picture it turns me completely white.. I don't like it! Probably better to stick with a the Pixel, Galaxy or iPhone.. I understand this this version was supposed to be sold in America but it's a Chinese company.. Americans in general like being tan so the camera should have been adjusted according.. I wouldn't buy again 1;	-0.1	2.6
B078T2T2FL	2	Good Phone, non-existent support or updates While Huawei made a good phone with the Mate 10 pro, it is sorely lacking in the support and updates category.

I cannot recommend this phone to anyone who values support and timely updates. 1;	-0.6	3.2
B078WZX9LD	2	Fake iPhone I think this is a knock-off item. On the back of the phone, it has the words “iPhone product”. It’s not a real iPhone. Also, it did not come with the earbuds and lightening jack connector as advertised. These we will end up needing to buy separately. It works, but it’s pricey for basically a fake iPhone. 1;	-0.2	1.8

B078YXJPRF	2	An impossible to like 'update' from my S6 The S6 was a terrific phone - responsive screen, predictable auto-brightness, and most of all NO CURVED SCREEN AND NO BIXBY INTEGRATION. The S8 (in my case, the S8 plus) is a disastrous, poor performing, bug-ridden nuisance. * Auto brightness? unpredictable. And with each update, the brightness meter is more and more hidden. * That Bixby button. Every phone holder triggers it. So does my pocket. or just picking the phone up. Or reaching for the down volume button. HI I'M BIXBY * The lack of a physical home button means you have to do everything twice. Did anyone complain that the S6 screen 'just wasn't big enough' ? No. So keeping that 1/5 of an inch to dedicate to a home button was what kept me on Samsung and away from the LG and Motorola phones. Well, that's gone. * Curved screens are stupid. They ruin the edge of photos and videos. There is no useful feature that takes advantage of it. And in 14 years I've never cracked a phone screen until this - the amazing Gorilla Glass with the curved edges. I don't know when it broke, but the glass is cracked AT THE EDGE. Wasn't this edge supposed to make phones stronger and more resistant to cracks? Fail. * Sure, phones need updates for security. But every update makes this phone slower and harder to use. Your camera buttons don't do what you expect them to do, and to get video you now have to *slide* to the video option instead of just hitting the 'record' button already on the camera interface. Samsung, you did everything possible to make me hate smartphones and you finally did it. I hate this phone and if I didn't need 2FA apps I'd use a flip phone. But I do need 2FA so I'll end up with whatever LG or Motorola still has a headphone jack. 1;	-0.2	11.2
B078YY1SFC	2	Disappointed with so called RENEWED phone Disappointed with this $280 RENEWED S8 Active phone. It showed lot of wear along bottom edge of phone near ear phone jack and charging port. Battery life not very good for 4,000 mAh battery. Touch screen not aligned properly for tapping on buttons/positions on screen. Won't connect to PC properly with usb cable to copy files unless you enable Developer mode to configure usb port each time which is a pain. Has several menu problems such as not being able to turn off wifi calling.... After about 2-1/2 weeks of messing with this phone, I gave up and made it my backup phone for a second number that I have. Then I ordered a USED S8 Active phone for $195 on Amazon, and it looks and works like great like a new phone, and I am Very Happy with it. Also it was $85 less than the so called RENEWED phone!!! 1;	-0.3	5.6
B078YY1SFC	2	"\Condition was NOT \""\""like new\""\"" - very beat up..\"" Arrived well-packaged, with a cheap non-OEM charger and 3' cable. Condition of this phone left *a lot* to be desired- the sides in particular were very badly scratched up.

B079C1K282	2	Great build, but poor refurbished quality. Received vied this item today and it initially looked brand new, until I took at the glass back. There were lots of micro scratches, which I guess is to be expected with a refurbished version. However, things got worse when I inserted my sim card and my card would not read. I withdrew the sim and tried again with no avail. I even tried restarting the phone, but no luck. The phone also would not connect to my wifi for some reason. The device feels great in hand. I love the screen display and build quality. I wish I was able to actually use it, but I am unable to because it won't respond to my sim (T-Mobile), nor will it connect to my home wifi, or any wifi as a matter of fact.

B079NQHRPS	2	When will I find a good phone for cheap? This phone is slow. I've restarted I've reset. Aside from rooting and putting on something that plays better with the hardware I've done what I'm supposed to. It sucks because it feels like a solid phone. And if I wait patiently for apps to start, they look really nice on the screen. Like watching Youtube or Netflix looks really good, but if I tap the icon and then tap somewhere else it sort of just freezes. Also it gets really hot while charging sometimes. Perusing a forum like reddit will cause the phone to need a restart because it will just lock up. I had high hopes. I remember Nokia dominating the market. Maybe a software update will come out because I am stuck with this one for a while. 1;	0.0	6.0

Going back to my older phone. Would refund if I could. If you're used to just having a functional phone, and don't care about speedy browsing then this is a great phone. I recommend it for people older than 40, or for work phones that you wont use to browse the web or play games. If you're a semi power user then hard pass on this. 1;	0.0	3.1
B079Z792J7	2	Really wanted to like this phone-most of it I did I got sick of the controlling Apple system about 3 years ago and decided to explore the android side of cellular. Did not want to spend a lot for a phone so I ordered up a Blu phone. It worked fine & it turns out I like the android world despite all the bashing from my family of iPhone users. $150 phone, what the heck...no need for insurance. Dunk it in the lake, which I did once, order another one. So I thought I would give the Moto6 a try. Turbo charge is cool, camera is ok if there is plenty of light, nice size. The only real problem was missing calls in my office. Never had that problem with my old iPhones or the cheap Blu phones. I'm still a cheapo, Just took my wife's hand-me-down 6 plus after she upgraded to an XR. I'll miss android and and the app selection for a while I guess. 1;	0.0	4.1

I purchased this Amazon Renewed device on 7-30 so it would be waiting at home when we got home on 8-2. The order was placed with CR Daily Deals and it arrived on 8-1.

They are very noticeable when the phone screen is off. The back of the phone has several scratches on the middle right and is chipped up around the camera, flash and fingerprint area where someone has a case on it and it got beat up around the opening. One side of the phone has a chip on the black surface that is noticeable since you can see the metal under it. The description for Amazon Renewed states clearly \""\""The products have no visible cosmetic imperfections when held 12 inches away.\""\"" These scratches and chips are very noticeable more than a foot away. I put my sim card in and the phone did work on Verizon. Thus far the phone has operated as intended and everything appears to be fine. Amazon either needs to adjust the description to state the phone may have scratches on the front  back and side noticeable at arms length or more or put CR Daily Deals on notice or remove them from this item. Phone works fine;"""	-0.1	6.1

It had dirt in the charging port and the speaker, so dirty that my earphones did not work with it. The screen and the back of the phone had a lot of scratches.

B07CHW5KMY	2	Beware!!! Phone software channel is RETLA (Latin America) if you want RETUS (United States). Beware!!! Phone software channel is RETLA (Latin America) if you want RETUS (United States). I did the research, so you don't have to, but I do suggest you read (google) these issues before buying this. Nowhere does it state this is a phone with a Latin America software channel that is updated in latin language but is only warranteed in the region it is purchased for. Also the U.S. version will be updated to Android Pie soon with possible no updates for this version. If your in the U.S. and want a phone that is updatable in english and warranted in the U.S, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. Look elsewhere and if you have to, pay a few dollars more and make sure it says U.S. version and warranty. If this does not matter to you, then it is a good buy, but beware if you have troubles connecting, etc. your cell provider cannot help you. I returned the phone and I was refunded promptly, so kudos to no problems there. I didn't rate this a 1-star due to the phone was new and nice, the seller did refund quickly as well. The rating is based solely on the limited info in this listing, the loss of my time without a phone and setting it up, returning it and having to buy elsewhere. Hope this helps someone else out.

B07CHWMYHP	2	Great phone but will break no matter what you do. Really liked this product and its my third Motorola. Worked well for two months then it wouldn't turn on and went to fastboot screen and dosent have the software or something. Yeah this product is a fantastic budget phone but if it stops working and I have to jump through inconvent hoops it's not worth it especially for me to have taken such care of the phone treated it good and then still have it randomly break. As someone who only buys good budget phones and takes care of their phones...no don't buy this it's just not worth it and I wish I had of listened to some of the more negative reviews instead of brand loyalty and YouTube reviews who only use a phone for 2 weeks at most...upset and will be last time I go with this. 1;	-0.2	3.9
B07CLWGC3T	2	It Is An Awesome Phone Until .... Have this phone for about over a month, it was a very well built, beautiful, top 5 sound quality phone. I would say it is even better than some of the Nokia or Sony phones that I had before (Sorry, I am one of those who would never purchase an overcharged iPhone or Samsung phone). However, today everything is not functioning all of the sudden - the touch screen is not responding and when it does, the screen is all blurry or two screen are overlay on each other. Then the fingerprint sensor is not working even the power on/off button so I can't even restart it .... will try to contact Asus, the seller or Amazon ..... What really upset me is that it just 6 days passed the return window so hopefully the warranty will help 1;	-0.2	3.3
B07D856BVR	2	If you've owned a Galaxy S7 or later, don't buy! I was really dissatisfied with this device. Coming from an iPhone X and needed a quick phone replacement, I was introduced to this device. As far as functionality goes, this phone is easy to use. Multitasking ability is also good. The main reason I returned this device is because it constantly froze up, and the camera (both) would freeze up randomly when using. The phone seems to be able to handle running a couple apps at a time before you have to start closing the apps you aren't using. It just seemed more of a headache than a blessing. 1;	0.0	5.5
B07D856BVR	2	Disappointing I had a Xiaomi Mi 5 before and loved it and am very disappointed by this one. Though the double-camera suggests an improvement, the pictures are actually of worse quality.

Most annoying of all, I keep getting an automated Chinese call, and blocking the number does not work as it just keeps changing. As usual for Xiaomi, ads are across the phone. 1;	-0.6	3.9

B07FMPVBQR	2	Frustrating manufacturing/software issue The phone has good hardware specs and a nice screen. The body feels cheap and is plastic unlike reviews I came across stating the phone was of metal construction. The phone unfortunately has real unfixable problems. There is a known memory issue with the phone that causes it to just lock up and become investigative for 5 seconds or so several times a day. If you lock the screen it will rotate and lock in the widescreen view several times a day. The unbearable frustrating issue is the unresponsive screen which requires that icons or links have to be double tapped constantly and it makes games nearly unplayable at times.

B07FZHHQB8	2	Did not receive a new product. I have always been a fan of Notes, and I really want to love this one. So far, I love (most of) the functionality, but I have definitely had some issues. When I first opened the box, there were scratches on the screen. I have only dropped this phone from maybe two feet and that's onto carpet in my room . But I figured I could deal with some scratches as they aren't impairing my ability to see anything on the screen. Right out of the box, the S Pen just fell out. It shouldn't be able to just fall out. The pen on my note 5 and note 8 fit snugly into the phone. So finally, I lost the pen, as it just wouldn't stay in the phone. I have yet to replace it because I dont see the point if it won't stay in place, and I don't know if it was the pen or the phone. The fingerprint reader works most of the time, but often makes me input my password anyway. The battery life is not what I would have expected from a new phone. I know over time it will lose its ability to hold a charge, but right out of the box, only using it for a combined total of maybe two hours a day, it should last more than 8 hours. I have been dealing with it because I dont use my phone for much these days besides GPS, alarms, and making plans. But I will go through phases where I sit on my phone for hours at a time. I'd draw on it a lot if I had the time. And an S Pen. But ultimately, losing the pen was kind of a final straw for me. For the cost of these phones, and if I did have more time to sit on my phone and really use it, I'd want it to be fully functional. What I received does not feel like a fully functional phone. 1;	-0.1	9.6

B07G8VPHG3	2	A mind of it's own. The speed of this phone and Android One is great. Very good picture, and meets all the basics. However, the phone has a mind of its own. It turns on in my pocket without touching the fingerprint reader, switches itself to Do Not Disturb mode or Airplane mode without notice, and the flashlight turns itself on at will. This has caused missed calls/texts and reduced battery life when the flashlight turns on. I've had this phone for 4 months, and will be getting a different one soon.

B07H8SBLBC	2	Case, Battery, and Ram are problems. The item description needs to be corrected. After a week with this phone, there's no doubt that the battery life is insufficient. Turns out its a different battery from the other E5 Play phones. It is a 'JE30'. I can't find the batteries on Amazon, hence no backup battery source. Other reviewers have mentioned the problem finding a case for this phone (E5 Play DL1920-19). I'm on my third ordered case, with no luck yet finding one that will fit. As others have noted, the RAM is only 1gb. There are features on this phone that I like, but I've decided I have to return the phone. The false item details in the description, such as the overstated RAM are bad enough, but the lack of a case for protection and insufficient battery with no backup simply make the phone unreliable. Really disappointing. I got this phone to replace my E4 that has gotten a cracked screen. This model of E5 is something entirely different; even different from the 'E5 Play' that the description says it is. Read the reviews; not the item description. 1;	-0.3	6.1
B07HC3CSMR	2	Comes without the protector/warranty!! I'm definitely not one for writing bad reviews, but this item is a real trap. The S8 is perfectly ok, comes in the original box and all, but I had to complain to costumer service at least three times before I was sent the Cellairis bundle! And even then, they're not making it easy to keep the phone protected...

B07HD2X91Q	2	Poor quality phone, sound issues, charging port issue after 4 months. The phone is a mediocre phone at best. Acceptable speed, battery life, screen and camera for casual use. Call quality was terrible using the phone mic, better on speakerphone. I had constant complaints about people not being able to hear me if I was using the handset. Disabling 'Enhanced LTE' features seemed to help a lot. After 4 months of use, the charging port has come loose, which it seems is now a common issue. The phone has not been abused or wet, and is not used with the cable, it is only plugged in at night to charge, so there should be no undue strain or wear on the port. Overall, not a great experience. If you are avoiding Chinese phones and want Android One, it is one of the only options at this time, but I'll be going back to a Samsung after wasting $350 on this for 4 months use. 1;	-0.5	6.2
B07HD2X91Q	2	stuck in download mode after 6 months of use I got this because it has a Zeiss lens camera and I thought I could use it for at least 5 years but it got stuck in download mode only 6 months after I started using it. I've tried resetting it per instructions found on Internet to no avail and I was told there is no easy fix except to send it back to the manufacturer. Also, the photos are backed up to the cloud automatically so I've used up cloud storage and need to delete or upgrade for more space. I'm wondering if I should have gotten the cheapest Apple phone. Searched the Internet for a Nokia Service Center in Austin, TX and found an address for it at 701 Brazos but the Hotel Omni at this location said there is no such company within the building and the only phone company at this address is Verizon.

B07HD2X91Q	2	nice features, crappy software So many stupid bugs that shouldn't exist. For example, you can't use an SD card with this device without setting it up as internal storage.

Sorry, I don't need to give up my camera, location, et.c to use my phone.

B07HD2X91Q	2	Caveat emptor. You may need to compromise with this phone The quality and look and feel in general is great, but nowhere in the specs or seller description says something about that if you use both sims, you cannot add an SD card to expand the storage capacity. In other words, you need to choose between to expand the phone’s storage capacity or use a second sim.

After bringing the phone back to my country, and discarding the box in another country , to the realize that it does not pick up WiFi is extremely frustrating!!!! This will now be an extra cost to have the phone taken to a phone technician to fix this problem ! I need some extra satisfaction from this amazon seller! ... I am extremely disheartened. 1;	-0.4	4.0

B07KNB1TN8	2	Canadian not a US Phone I bought my Note 9 from Quick Deals CR Via Amazon. The phone is absolutely fantastic and in great condition. However, the problem is that it is not a US phone as advertised. It was unlocked but it is the Canadian Variant made for the mobile company Telus. I tried to use it for a month on Tmobile. It does work but has limited access to the mobile bands that Tmobile uses in the US. I loved the phone but unfortunately had to return it because it doesn't work properly in the US. 1;	0.1	2.7

Huawei is banned by our government and as far as I know, Google has dropped them. I didn't realize all this when ordering the phone, and I believe that may have had something to do with not being able to complete the setup.

Charges fast, runs everything fast, fine camera for most uses, the fingerprint reader is a bit overly sensitive but that's not too bad but unlocks a bit easier by mistake at times.

B07N4M412B	2	"Close but not quite \So I have been using the phone for a bit over a month now. Often I find myself using the pattern unlock vs using the finger print reader, as it can take a few times to get it to unlock with my thumbprint. Battery life is just meh and it seems to take a long, long time to charge. I bought a wireless fast charger that was Samsung and Samsung certified but it takes like 9 hours to charge up the phone if I let it get down to 10 to 15%. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0797F2V5C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Corded charging does work better but it's still a slow charge compared to the nexus 70% charge in 15 minutes. I have used the built in batter saver app and even cutting everything down and scrimping wherever I can I find it drops 10 to 15% of its charge overnight just sitting on the dresser doing nothing. If I am using it to just listen to music a few hours can eat 30 to 40% power. This is not streaming, its music that has been downloaded to the phone. This seems like way too much power usage for this. The screen seems vibrant and colorful. However, It also has wrapping issues, where text and the picture often are fitted off the edge of the screen. I was looking through the Samsung app store and they had an advertisement for one of the apps. It took me a couple minutes to figure out one of the words as it was so far off the screen. The word was world and all I could see was the WO...I find this annoying. The screen is also smaller than what I expected the Plus model to be. I did like that it integrates with my car pretty well and the maps has a cool feature that will allow you to display the map from a satelite view. However, I found that if i tried using this mode while trying to play music, the sound and map developed stutter and played choppy. However, I did like that it (in general) did actually show the speed limit of the roads I was traveling and I never saw that on my old Nexus and is a feature I missed that you see in almost every cheap GPS unit. Cellular signal is much worse than my previous Nexus 6 P device. I often find in places where I had 3 to 4 bars of signal on the nexus I often get 1 bar and I see the dreaded \""\""no signal icon\""\"" pretty often  especially when on the drive home.

B07N4M412B	2	It's definitely not a S8 My last Galaxy was a S8. Samsung has made some changes since then.

B07N91S9MW	2	The Moto G7 represents the current budget phone design trend and I don't like it. I'm replacing a Moto G5+ that's got a cracked screen and has become frustratingly slow over the last few months. Overall I liked my Moto G5+ so I thought the G7 was a safe choice. The first shock I had with the G7 is how huge it is in comparison. I no longer felt I was carrying a phone but instead a miniature tablet. After checking the market I see that every major phone manufacturer is making budget phones with 6-inch plus screens in 2019. I have a hard time finding small budget phones for these new releases and instead have to look at previous years releases. Performance wise it's very similar to my old G5+ when I first bought it. The camera is a little slow but I don't use it a whole lot. Overall it performs well in everyday usage. The battery life is nothing incredible, it's pretty average and considering the large size of the phone I'd say even a little disappointing. I can burn through it in a day if I want but it usually lasts me two full days. Overall I don't think I'll stick with this phone. I don't like the large size nor do I like the current trend of making the budget phones huge. I would appreciate some smaller budget options with good hardware and smart compromises. I think instead I will try the old but still relevant Moto X4 which is roughly the same size as my old G5+ but has better hardware. 1;	0.0	6.0

However, after owning it for a couple months, here are a few issues I've come across: 1. Half of my incoming calls automatically gets forwarded to voicemail without a single ring. It doesn't matter if reception is good. This may be due to how my carrier (T-mobile) connects with this phone. I've tried adjusting every setting I know of, but nothing has worked so far.

B07NZXXZB2	2	Drops mobile data Bought this phone in March 2019 and after a few months it started dropping mobile data. After repeated checks with my service provider it was confirmed that the problem was with the phone and not the service. This was verified through various forums and chats by other persons in different countries with the S10 who had the same problem. Whenever I leave an area with wifi, I have to go to the sim card manager and change from 4g to 3g then back to 4g to get mobile data. As soon as I get a call I lose mobile data and have to go 3g then 4g again to get it back. Same thing if the signal gets weak or I go in and out of a wifi area. Huge risk if attempted while driving.

The only complaints so far is that you cannot take a picture and text it to someone through Net10 with this phone. Also, it kicks off of our Wi-Fi a lot, which is a pain. But otherwise it takes decent pictures, and works well. Good call quality and signal. 1;	0.3	3.5

B004H23JXW	3	"Windows Phone 7 is great, Samsung Focus is solid, DOES come unlocked, but has suspicious packaging \Straight from the vendor the phone is, in fact, unlocked (we use it on T-Mobile, but it should work with any GSM network with a SIM card, but NOT Verizon or Sprint or CDMA networks). This is our second Samsung Focus (the first was directly through Amazonwireless) and we love this phone! AT&T has dropped the ball big-time on updates, however, and you can only upgrade it to WP 7.5 Mango. There are several security/bug fix updates in between WP 7.5 and 7.8 that AT&T will not allow Microsoft to push to your phone, but overall this is a great entry-level smart phone and you simply cannot beat the price now that it has been out a couple of years. Since the phone is branded to AT&T (even though it is unlocked and can be used on any GSM network) you will simply not be able to get any updates on this phone until AT&T decides to bless you with them (which in all likelihood based on their history, is NEVER). Also, the box that the phone came in was sealed, but did not have \""\""Samsung\""\"" or \""\""AT&T\""\"" anywhere on the box except a printed out sticker. The original Focus I got from Amazonwireless directly  had a normal flashy orange AT&T box with Samsung written all over it. The product manual inside of this new unlocked phone's box also suspiciously does not say Samsung or AT&T on it. To make matters worse;"""	0.0	2.7
B004H23JXW	3	Not the greatest phone While this phone came out a couple of years ago, it's still a serviceable smart phone if you're not looking for the latest and greatest. If you are looking for something more fully fleshed out I would recommend either the latest Android or iPhone. I did notice some glaring omission/annoyance from this OS and Windows Phone 8 so I'll list the positive and the negatives below. Pros: 1. relatively cheap smart phone 2. Upgradable to Windows Phone 7.5 maybe eventually 7.8 3. Light weight 4. Good wifi reception Cons: 1. Cannot block calls/numbers. (I can't understand why this basic feature isn't present. It's on my 3yr old dumb candy bar phone and yet there's no way to do this either under Windows phone OS or apps. 2. Cannot customize alerts with SMS/MMS or voicemails 3. Battery is weak. A fully charge battery with battery saver feature turned on and in idle mode will last a little over 2 days. Those are pretty much my take on the phone. 1;	-0.1	5.3
B004H23JXW	3	Nice Product When it works Pros: Nice OS Nice Screen Nice Camera Nice Mail management. Cons: Battery life: 1-day (You will have to charge the phone at night as an iPhone) HARDWARE NO GOOD Update: March 17 2012 Mine died like this: [...] 1;	0.0	1.6

B005JGSVCE	3	Samsung Haven U320 Verizon Flip Cell Phone Nice size flip phone for the price. But be aware it DOESNT have a camera feature on it. That fact wasn't mentioned in the info I found on Amazon prior to my ppurchasing it. I had to order another one that did, because this was to be a phone my husband could use on his job, which required him to take pictures of his work sometimes. 1;	0.1	1.2
B005JGSVCE	3	Don't buy this phone. While the phone is easy to use the buttons didn't work all the time so I had to trade it in. The second phone I received wouldn't keep a charge so I had to purchase a new battery which was extremely hard to find since this is an older phone. 1;	-0.3	1.3

B007X6FFLS	3	Wasn't what I was looking for It's a little misleading in that you really do have a contract of sorts and you will probably buy a lot of minutes that you will end up not using as they expire each month. I think these phones are a better deal for the service provider than the consumer, but you may have utilization behaviors that actually fit well to these types of agreements.

B008PAW5EQ	3	NOT unlocked for Page Plus: misleading description This is a nice little flip phone and we were excited to get it for my father; that is the reason I gave it 3 stars. I took off two stars because of the misleading description. The description of this phone is wrong: it states that the phone is unlocked for Page Plus, which is incorrect. As we tried to activate the phone ourselves on pagepluscellular.com, we got an error code and couldn't get it activated. We spoke to a customer service rep who told us the phone was incompatible with Page Plus. We also took the phone to a local Page Plus vendor who also tried to activate it and was told it was incompatible. So we bought another phone and returned this one: please do not buy this if you want this for Page Plus. 1;	-0.7	5.9

B009ZC91AY	3	LTE phone with 4G signals Only ! I ordered 920 LTE phone-BLACK with paid delivery fee. It arrived fast from SHIPFASTTECH, but I also discovered fast that the phone from this seller could not get LTE. I compare my wife's phone, same model different color, ordered from different seller for lower price and no shipping fee. Hers has LTE signal, and mine doesn't. No matter how I change the settings, update the software or call ATT, 4G is it, an LTE phone with 4G signals only. Just to make the matter clearer, Lumia 920 has two models, one with 4G/LTE and another 4G only. I tried ##3282# for phone Field Test. Initially, it showed nothing, but after multiple phone software updates, it did show something, but still without LTE. Actually, it shows LTE is Invalid and NA in all LTE related fields. As for my wife's 920, it has every parameter/value shown in her phone Field Test results. What has happened to this phone now? I still have it, because it's such a nice phone. It would be perfect only if LTE is available to my phone. 1;	0.0	4.3
B009ZC91AY	3	Best phone but would be better if it had 64GB or 128GB COME ON! With a camera like that- like THAT Nokia, what the hell is the deal with a measly 32GB??? This phone rocks, rocks like a boss - OR WOULD rock like a boss if it had the storage capacity of the modern century. It's ridiculous, if you're an audiophile - like me! And a serious pro photographer - again like me! 32GB will go like yesterdays hot wings. Bottom line if you are like me and make a lot of pics and listen to a ton of photos, this phone can't handle it, not at 32GB. But if you don't have music and wouldn't bother making a lot of great photos with the amazing camera on this phone, then by all means buy it. It is a fantastic device. 1;	0.1	6.1

B00B2BYU1Q	3	I bought this phone from Breed and after a week it stoped working At the beginning I was very disappointed since I bought this as a gift to my son and after a little bit more than a week the screen went black and after that it was dead. Thanks to Amazon support I was able to get guidance to solve the problem. I did as the manufacturer recommended and it starts working again.It has frozen a couple of times since then, but I am giving it the benefit of the doubt since the phone system is running some updates I hope can solve the problem.

Have tried to hook up the Nokia suite but it will not connect under any conditions - which is one of the main reasons I switched back to Nokia. 3. Does have a nice display 4. Will not stay shut off when charging - Will always come back on. 5. Have found customer support to be next to none - see # 1 6. For some reason I cannot put some dates into next year. Will add them and then they just disappear. 7. The calendar does not allow duplication by day of the month (ex. third Wednesday) 8. Adobe - not all of their programs work with this model. 9. Does a good job with email 10. Bluetooth works well with our home phone system 11. The feedback to Nokia has never worked - and it has always been turned on. 12. Battery life has been good - but I do put it on the charger every night. 13. Apparently AT&T does not offer 4G - so I was not able to take advantage of it - or the phone will not recognize it. 14. Got a Trident case and it fits better than a glove. FYI - my friend had a 1120 and returned it 3 times for replacement before he got a different brand. Same problem on the sending photos with sms. Yes we are both on AT&T but different ISP. 1;	0.0	13.0

B00CQAOIIC	3	I've had worse The windows phone is new to me. The operating system appears to work well and the phone itself is very responsive and quick. It's easy to get use to the new layout as opposed to the Android that I'm use to. The only thing I don't like is that the phone is so symmetrical that you just can't tell which end is up by feel. You have to be looking at it and there must be light, because you need to be able to see the buttons on the side. It doesn't help that the buttons are the exact shade of black as the rest of the phone. I wish the buttons were white. Also the buttons are poorly placed so that you almost can't help but to press one just by holding the phone. Also, the phone is hard to hang onto. It's like a bar of soap. A little forethought could have gone a long way with this design. It would be a lot better if it were squared off and if it had something to distinguish the top from the bottom. 1;	0.0	6.1

B00ECAABBC	3	Ok for the price. Its Ok for the price. I have a Sony Xperia Z2 and I was comparing the camera... It wasnt much of a difference, but this phone can really shine at taking pictures with low light and at nigth. I dont really like Microsoft OS. Its so simple that it becomes difficult, and also the store is so empty, and not enough people grading the application. The battery seems to run out faster than my Xperia Z2. I think the 41 megapixles camera is just a commercial gimmick because I cant really notice a huge difference vs my Xperia Z2. It takes me a couple of seconds after taking a picture in 5 Jpeg+ 36 DNG MP option, its kind of delayed but its something you would expect with an UnderPowered Processor. When I play games Its ok for now since the phone doesnt have tons of aps. Pro: -Price. -Camera. -Design. look and feel sturdy. -Nokia. Yup the brand lolz. Cons: -Windows OS. I like Android OS better, The interface is so annoying for example to switch on/off WIFI/GPS/DATA/ etc In a Android phone you can just tap the uper part of the screen and it will show up. But on this phone you have to go all the way to settings to do it. The lack of customization is also an issue on this OS. -Store. the highest rated apps have around 13!!! votes. You cant make a choice with only 13 ratings!!. Your only option is to download it. -Battery. Only 2000 mAh while others have around 3000 mAh. Lasting nearly 50% less. I have to charge this phone daily, and I dont even use it that much, just a couple of hours a day for whatssap/fb/browsing/music nothing heavy, I use wifi. Data/GPS/ BT/ are off and even the screen is at lowest contrast setting. There is no way to tell what app is draining your battery... -NO SD slot, Only internal memory. 32 GB is nothing when you can only use around 20 GBs. -Non-removable battery. That is right, If your phone gets bricked you wont be able to take the battery out, this method would fix most error/ crashes. -NO PLAYLIST. Seriously the only way to create a playlist for songs is connecting this phone to a computer and making the playlist at media player. IT TAKES BLOODY 5 minutes!!! How could they fxck this up so bad!. It takes me 1 minute and much less effort to make a playlist on an Android phone!. I use my cellphone a lot for music, this makes me want to downgrade the vote to 2 stars. Neutral: -Speed. Its not that bad, sometimes freezes for a couple of seconds when Im scanning throught music or pictures. The processor is Kind of Underpowered but for the price... Cant complaint. -Screen resolution, glare, colors. Average. -Speaker/ sound. -This phone cant take burst shots (talking about 3-5 photos a second). -The auto setting for taking photos is really bad. Most of the time it looks blurry, dark, bright, or foogy. But on the hand if you manually set the focus, contrast, colors, This camera rules. Can beat my Z2 quality anytime. The only downside is that you could take sometime manually adjusting the settings. -The bump in the back (camera) does not bother me at all. Looks sexy. Overall this phone with the cost of nearly half the price of an Iphone and others competitors, its not a bad option. 1;	-0.1	20.6

Anyway, the charger does not work at all now....and I have only used it one other time😤 So now I'm only giving it 3 stars...the phone it self is great and easy...just a BASIC phone! 1;	0.0	2.8

B00EP2BN00	3	Such high hopes. Disappointed. We are having difficulty with one of the two phones we ordered. It has to be recharged frequently and they both sometime fail to ring alerting us of an incoming call, therefore, we miss calls. They seem to have a delay in lighting up when flipped open. 1;	-0.2	2.1
B00EP2BN00	3	Solid phone, feels like its a generation old Cons: The phone is thicker and heavier than it should be given the year and competition. As far as I can tell the PTT button (red) is not active on the phone unless you pay additional money. Pros: The construction is rugged and feels like the phone can stand a good deal of abuse. Summary: There are better Verizon models out there. 1;	0.1	2.0

It would be prefect if i could add 10 mp camera to this phone. no internet. Also it would be good to have auto answering for in coming calls. Cells today are going to the bigger end so they can do internet. Now I do text off and on. Maybe easier to type a text.

B00F9RRVUG	3	A light serviceable phone This review is for Samsung A157V. Pros: it is a light and straightforward to use no frill cheap phone. Voice quality is decent Cons: no camera.

B00FJ8YCZM	3	Almost my dream phone The screen is big enough that I was able to ditch my tablet. Some say the big screen is a downside, but since I always use my LG HBS-730 Tone+ Stereo Bluetooth headset with it, I don't count it as such. My only downside is that it has all the Samsung stuff pre-installed and there is no easy way to uninstall it. I wish I could have the Nexus experience on this hardware. I am moving from an open Google Nexus branded phone and the proprietary Samsung experience and it is not even comparable. The Google Nexus experience wins hands down. The Samsung hardware wins hands down. This is why the old Google Nexus S by Samsung did so well; the best of both worlds. 1;	0.2	3.5
B00FJ8YCZM	3	GREAT phone with AWFUL call quality! LOVE this phone, but I realized that I don't use all of the features the phone has. It works great for social media, texting emailing, and web-surfacing. Previously I had the Samsung Galaxy S2 and switching from that to the Note 3 was a huge jump because the Note 3 is HUGE! It's a little difficult to handle with one hand, but you'll get used to it over time. I thought the S4 was large, but hold a Note 3 and see the difference! The call quality is AWFUL, unfortunately! This is one of the most popular phones on the market and the last thing anyone would think would be wrong with the phone is the call quality. The calls are fuzzy and are in and out all of the time. I read the reviews about the call quality before purchasing the phone and didn't think that I would experience it, but I am experiencing it. That's certainly a downer for spending $300 on the thing. 1;	-0.1	5.8
B00HWEJJSQ	3	Had To Use Another Phone To Charge Battery The product arrived in a timely manner and appeared to be in good condition. However, I was only able to begin using it after finally determining that the phone would not charge. The battery was critically low upon my receipt of the phone, so I tried to charge it by using the included cord and charging adapter. It would not indicate active charging and continued to deplete the charge. I used a different outlet, with the same result. I then used two other spare charging units to see if that would solve the problem; it did not. Eventually I was able to figure out that the phone I received simply would not charge. I ended up using another phone to charge the battery and swapped out the depleted one with the one I'd charged with another phone. I was quite disappointed and find the necessity of using another phone as a charger to be very inconvenient. 1;	-0.3	3.9
B00HWEJJSQ	3	Seller sucks, phone is great It gets 3 stars because the phone is fantastic once I got it running. I bought it referbed and physically is wonderful, buuuut the seller used some cheap half-a$$ Chinese root program that took me 2 days to fix.

On top of that, I charged the phone all the way up to 100% and it still wont keep a good charge.It keeps dying and I now have to purchase a new battery from a store.

B00I3OIXJU	3	Great for the price. Based on price, this is an excellent phone. The GPS functionality alone is worth the under $40 pricetag. Update to 8.1 went well. Phone is smooth. Battery lasts 2 days for me under light use. I'm hoping that will improve as the battery is cycled. Using with T-Mobile prepaid. Windows is way different from Android. There's no 'glamour' to this phone but I did not want glamour. It just works. Update: Browser is just awful. Crashes, faulty Back button behavior, just overall bugginess. 1;	0.0	5.5
B00IDTU8PC	3	Not good at first blush...but then.... When I first got this I took it to the T-Mobile store to have the SIM moved from my old Galaxy J3 phone to this Galaxy S4 phone. All appeared to work wel except that once I got it home I was unable to hear voice either from the earpiece or speaker. Bluetooth worked OK so I knew it was on the T-Mobile network when I used a bluetooth headset. All the while the data and SMS worked fine. Again I was sure it was on the T-Mobile network. I was about to return it when when T-Mobile notified me of an Android update and I allowed it to perform the update. It began to work perfectly after that. I cancelled the return and all is well. A note to all: The picture is somewhat misleading in that you get a phone, a battery, and a wall charger all loosely packed in a bag with bubble wrap inside a box. It is not Samsung OEM accessory equipment. It also does not come in a Samsung box. The modular Samsung pieces shown in the picture are not provided. I am sure if I would have contacted Amazons offered support some of this would have been solved earlier in the day. The help at the T-Mobile store did not like not having sold me this phone and thus did not do anything but a cursory swap of the SIM and called it good at that point. Any time you engage in the purchase of electronic goods where the ongoing support of a service required to utilize it, and when that is provided by another party to the transaction, you may be at a disadvantage. Fortunately in this case both T-Mobile network backend services and Amazon support services came through with good results. Update October 2017: Ultimately I had to return the product. The loss of voice on the phone continued to reappear. Research indicated mixed possibilities of Android and Google software behaviors, Samsung design changes, and possible hardware/software incompatibilities being the root of the problem. I simply could not make use of a phone that only operated on bluetooth headset. 1;	-0.2	8.0

Unless you already have used a Prepaid Phone on your account for at least 6 months, you can't transfer it to your phone plan.

Calendar entries and to-do lists show up right on the home screen. On the negative side: You kind of need a magnifying glass to read email and facebook. The touch screen is not always responsive and downloading of apps often stops midway through even when connected to wi-fi. Also, there are not that many apps available, but if that's important to you, you'd probably go with an android or iphone anyway. I bought this phone because it's unlocked so I don't have to pay through the nose for an expensive monthly plan that's much more than I need.

I never utilized the gaming functions, but my kid did and downloaded a bunch of cool kid games. You get what you get. Depending on your provider, you can stream video and music easily.

I am not on the I phone constantly. I was at the airport and needed my boarding pass and the phone over heated. I had to wait until it cooled down to be able to board the plane. The vendor said to take the phone to Best Buy and buy a new battery and they would reimburse me for it. very disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 1;	0.0	4.9

B01CR2IA6Y	3	The iPhone 6s is a good phone, but the one that was sent to me was not The iPhone 6s is a good phone, but the one that was sent to me was not. The battery only holds 70% of the full capacity (for comparison my 6 year old iPhone 4 is at 64%), and dies so quickly that sometimes the battery dies even on the charger in airplane mode. I assumed that this just meant that the battery needed to be re-calibrated, so I attempted a full charge cycle. Instead of automatically shutting off to keep from causing damage like it's supposed to, the phone slowed to a crawl (under 0.1 frames per second), the display slowly got a purple tint, and then the screen shut off, followed by the flash. While this is not happening at the moment, for awhile whenever 3D Touch was used on the display it would make an obnoxious clicking sound. On some parts of the display 3D Touch won't work unless you press down very hard, and on other spots it is almost impossible to touch it normally without setting it off. The camera is somewhat grainy, and even when compared to other 6s cameras or an SE looks bad. My final verdict is, buy a 6S, just get it somewhere else. 1;	-0.5	4.9

If you plan to use this phone heavily, be prepared to charge it twice or more times a day. I am personally disappointed with the battery, I thought Sony would know better on this one.

B01FJT7E3M	3	Decent price w/a BUNCH of small problems The phone was priced well. Speaker phone is good, doesn't decrease in volume over time like many. The camera on this phone produces nice pics and video. However, after a few months, I notice there is a delay between when you take the pic, the image produced, and when the camera will be ready to take another pic... This sucks when you ask someone to tk 2 pics back to back for you and now they have to wait with the spinning wheel for the cam to recoil. The phone comes loaded up with way too many Sony apps one must disable. When you try to send video texts there always seems to be problem; often says file is too large no matter what the size. I didnt have this prob before this phone; I had to download another app to get around that problem. For whatever reason the screen is really bright and adjustment through settings does not help as much as one wld expect.I also get intermittent trouble with Bluetooth functions.... Some devices it just doesn't pick up they way for example my Samsung Galaxy wld or it may disconnect. Also, the phone in my opinion is a little heavier than comparably sized phones. The back panel does no come off for easy battery access, this is by design. (I watched a few videos on how to get it off). 1;	-0.1	5.8

B01FJT7MZC	3	Good camera does not make up for unimpressive battery life, call quality and ability to stand up to heavy use. Rather lackluster call quality, battery life and ruggedness. Even a fairly small drop from a few feet caused the screen to break. People I called often complained of echo compared to other phones I used (Moto G). Speaker phone and audio also substandard. Also the phone itself has a chunky form factor and small screen and is too slippery. Really the only outstanding feature of this unit is the camera and the fact that it is waterproof but these aspects do not redeem its other shortcomings. If you want a phone for heavy use, look elsewhere. 1;	-0.3	4.0

B01FJT7N4W	3	Seems nice but I'm not going to marry this phone model Phone seems to be working fine, after all, it is a new phone, we'll see as the months and use progresses. It's not a Samsung Galaxy but close enough, it is nice on its own. I love the different screen lock features, very relieving. Camera, Volume, and Power buttons are located in an inconvenient corner of the phone, right in the middle right hand corner??? Instead of towads the top so you can operate it with your thumb or index finger. Volume and Camera are below the power button, so I guess I need to learn to use my middle, ring, and pinky to operate those. Might as well become a Pianist after this! lol. It doesn't seem like it is easy to open by any means, I haven't even tried yet, hopefully I never have to replace the battery. A plus is that the SIM card and the Mini SD are conveniently loaded through a side drawer without having to open the phone and remove the battery. I ordered mine in black and got a silver one instead, without any explanation for a substitution. Maybe it was just a mistake, but how can a company confuse black with silver, it still baffles me! 1;	0.0	4.5

The main home button was a little sticky when pressed - but still functioned fine. The battery \""\""health\""\"" was 78% out of the box.

B01GXAZFR8	3	A “used” phone is not the same as a “refurbished” It works, arrived mostly fine cosmetically, with the exception of some slight fading on the outer case due to sticker or case that the previous owner must have used. The big concern for me is the phone reports a battery health of 86% (i.e. 6% away from being throttled and need to be replaced), which means I likely have the original battery the phone came with. That’s fine if I was buying a used phone, but ANY refurbished phone should come with a new battery. Refurbished doesn’t just mean cleaning an old phone. That this one has a battery that’s 2+ years old makes me nervous about what “diagnostic” and/or repair work was actually done before selling it. I’ll just have to keep an eye on it during the warranty period and see what happens I guess. 1;	0.0	1.7

B01L1BOQT2	3	Good device for basic usage needs, but mediocre battery The product thus far works as you’d expect an iPhone to work. However, as many other reviews mention, the biggest drawback to these refurbished iPhones is the battery life. My device had an 80% capacity reading in the settings. When batteries are worn this much, they are unable to provide as much power as the phone needs sometimes, causing it to simply crash. So your only options at this point are a slower phone (IOS automatically throttles the phone once this crash happens, which you can disable) or one that’s more likely to crash.

B01LACBLEK	3	Great but not all the way. I have this phone now for exactly 2 years. Here are the pros and cons: Pros: - perfect size (small but not so much that keyboard is hard to use). Fits inside pocket just fine. - photos are really great quality. My wife has an iphone7 and when we take important photos, she always asks that I take them with my phone. This is especially true in lower light conditions. - screen is very nice, with good color representation, good blacks, and OK in the bright light. I wish it could go a bit dimmer, but then I shouldn't be watching Netflix from bed at night. - I put in a 256MB SD card, this is a great feature, I only with that WhatsApp could save things directly onto it, but that is not the case (I know there is a way to root the phone etc. but I wish this was possible as a default, and agree it could be an app limitation, that has nothing to do with phone.) - Waterproofing: I didn't even know it was water proof when I bought it. I dropped the phone into the ocean from my boat and retrieved it from about 3m deep after about 15 minutes (was really retrieveing my wallet as I was using a phone wallet). To my surprise, the phone worked like it did before. Since, I have used it in the pool, rain, etc. Only issues some times was small condensation on camera when the phone was hot and I put it in colder pool water. Goes away in day or two (suggesting Sony put an anti fog coating on the inside in front of camera). Cons: - Charging port: main reason for writing this review is from that after about 1.5 yeas of owning this phone, the charging port (USB-C type connector, for which I had high hopes) has become a bit loose and worn out. It is getting progressively worse, and I know this from back when phones I had, had the micro USB connector. As I have had similar issues in previous phones, I generally take great care to not press hard or bend the charging cable when plugged in, and because of that I did expect that, combined with USB-C connector, which seems sturdier, I would not have this issue. I was wrong, and disappointed that the issue is getting worse. Now, at two years, I need to look for at least a minute to find the right spot for charging. This could have been somewhat aleviated by wireless charging, but thsi phone does not come with it. As an opinion, I think this could be how the companies get you to buy new phones these days. However, given my frustration with this, I don't think I will be going for another Xperia phone next time. I have ordered a replacement socket for now, and will try to change it out myself when it arrives (15$). I hope the waterproof seal will not be compromised during this procedure. - Not a great multi-tasker. On many occasions I have had issues with usingmultiple apps. Fro example, when I am booking flights with the Expedia App, and switch to another app to view my document details that I need to put into Expedia, upon return to Expedia I would be forced to re-start my search. This issues has happened with many apps, when switching between them. Even Gmail, I had to re-start writing e-mails at times, as the app just re-set itself back to main inbox screen, rather than remaining in the e-mail writing. overall the phone was great, and I hope I can fix the charging issue and continue using this phone for at least another year or two. Taking off 1 star for the charging and 1 for the multitasking issues. 1;	0.0	16.6

Every phone I've had since 2008 has had a glass screen, I didn't even think to check if this did. -Plastic case is really slippery, slides off most surfaces with very little effort -Power/volume button are down low, so it's hard to access from your pocket or in a cup holder -Corners are rather sharp and not very fluid with holding it in your hand -Loaded with bloatware, I'm constantly asked to do things I don't want and most of the newest versions of apps are terrible (in my humble opinion) 1;	-0.5	4.1

B01MRH0YND	3	An Alternative to Going to Carrier for Replacement Arrived promptly, easy to activate. The fingerprint recognition feature on this unit doesn't work, which is not enough for me to bother with exchange. It's probably why it got refurbished in the first place. Aside from that, it looks and functions as well as the phone it replaced. I'm thankful to circumvent dealing with the carrier for replacement. UPDATE 3/7/19: The phone truly gave up the ghost; a new battery didn't help it. Went against an upgraded model in the first place to suit my mom, who has no interest in new phone features. For what was paid, not a great value. 1;	-0.1	4.4

The camera did not come with a SIM card; I had to buy that separately. And lastly, the phone had a few small cratches on the sides of it. Nothing too server, but I wish they would have mentioned that in the description. All and all the phone isn’t terrible, I just expected better. 1;	-0.1	4.3

B01MSEPCPU	3	Version A1779, Japanese version, which cannot mute when taking photos... I just got it for two hours, so the review would be changed after a couple of days using. 1. It is pre-owned. no scratch, but wear can be seen around the back camera, speaker and mute button. 2. The model is A1779, which is a Japanese version. Due to the Japanese law, it cannot be mute (even you turn off the sound) when taking photos... it really annoying me, it is a basic requirement in my mind... I really did not expect Amazon would ship me a Japanese version... so -1 star. 3. The battery is not healthy. It shows 79% maximum capacity in the battery report. Compares to my own IPhone7+ which has been used for almost years, it is 86%. so -1 star. 4. Extremely hot...

The Best Buy technician said the battery was at 82% and didn't warrant replacement, but I had them replace it anyway for $50 as the phone would be useless to me if it couldn't hold a charge.

All of the ports; headphone jack, charger, sim card, silent button, they all had a large build up of dirt in them.

I guess the only thing Samsung really invests in is their flagships, but at $1200 a pop, I won't be standing in line...ever.

B06Y16RL4W	3	Not unlocked!!! This phone was not unlocked! Took it to Verizon and the tech could not get the SIM to activate. He tried 10 different cards so the problem was with the phone. I read other reviews that said the same thing. HOWEVER...there is a workaround! He had to put the SIM in another new phone, activate it, and then switch it to my phone. So glad it worked because I really like this phone and it was a lot cheaper than buying a new S9. 1;	0.0	2.7

B06Y3KRV1W	3	Replacement unit seems to work correctly and does not power down like the first unit Got one unit that had to be returned because it would shutoff randomly with different battery percentage remaining.

B06ZZVZKTR	3	Good phone for the price, but think carefully about your needs This a good phone at a very reasonable price. Do not buy if you are looking for a phone with all the latest technology. This phone does not support using WiFi for calls when the cell signal is weak. It is a great feature if the cell signal at home is weak or spotty. I had that feature in my other Moto phone and it worked very well. If I had realized the feature missing I may not have bought this phone. The back of the phone is plastic, not metal. I discovered that if you put the phone in your back pocket and sit, the phone will bend, even after a couple of times. Do not sit on the phone. It will bend. Even with all this, it is a good phone for the price. 1;	0.0	5.1

B06ZZVZKTR	3	Good for the phone and bad for charging Good phone, just great for the money paid for the E4. But the battery life Span is too short and takes an average of 4.5 hrs to charge full. Too long, but dies of within 2.5 hrs if used non stop. 1;	0.2	1.2
B06ZZVZKTR	3	Hard to hear. Screen malfunctions at 1.5 years Very disappointed in sound quality. What is the point of a phone if you must strain to hear it? Speaker phone helps somewhat but not enough. Speaker phone may protect ears but no good for privacy in public areas. Only short conversations with this phone no matter how quiet the environment because exhausting trying to hear. Unfortunately (fortunately?) the screen malfunctions at only 1.5 years (with protective case) which is past warranty. Costs more to fix it than to try a different phone -- this time making sure reviewers say good sound. Will be avoiding Motorola. 1;	-0.3	4.0

B071ZDQ6MV	3	Frustrating for a first-time Android owner / iPhone convert I waffled between 2 or 3 stars, but this is my first Android phone so I don't know how much of my frustration is due to the device and how much due to the operating system. I switched from an iPhone 6+ almost four months ago, and it's been four months of frustrations. It does many things without trouble, but it does not do most things well. I really wanted to like this phone, but now I really want to set it free. However, I will vow be patient with it until at least the end of June; I vow to spend more time and effort in forums trying to find other users' solutions; I vow to update my review at that time, and may even outline any specific complaints I have for which I still haven't found solutions. I'm a very conscientious user and habitual problem solver, but with its myriad clunkinesses this phone has been wearing on my patience and productivity. Special note to Mac users: This phone does not want to play with the Mac, and the Mac does not want to play with this phone. There's a really hokey way to connect to the phone's file system, but you don't get to enjoy the convenience and ease of systems communing with natural kinship. 1;	-0.1	3.5
B071ZDQ6MV	3	Decent overall; TERRIBLE sound quality for media Overall a workable phone- not as fast as some of the newer models but decent speed for the price. Battery life is strong as well- if you charge every night you'll have enough power to get through the day with no issues, even with heavy use. The only downside is the sound quality for media- constant, and I mean CONSTANT, low level static either from its own speaker or even through headphones. I don't totally understand why because call quality is fine. If you use your phone heavily for music, podcasts, etc, this is not the phone for you. No matter what, it sounds like you're listening to music through broken headphones. 1;	-0.1	4.0
B071ZDQ6MV	3	Nice device but needs more customizable features The phone looks really nice and feels even better in the hand. I didn't like it as much because it wouldn't allow the numerical percentage indicator for the battery (picky, I know, but none the less). Some other flaws for me were the home button was too low on the handset which made it awkward to hold and you can't change the orientation of the square and triangle soft keys. I think Nokia did a great job for the price point considering the screen size, the overall look of the device and the screen resolution, however, buyers need to understand that it isn't as customizable as some other lower priced phones on the market. If that's what you want, I recommend looking at their higher priced models. 1;	0.1	2.7

B071ZDQ6MV	3	Nokia 6...not impressed. I've only had this phone one day, but I can say..for me..it does not match it's hype! My previous/current phone is a BLU Studio Energy 2. I was moving to this because the BLU has a built into it's software PUP (look it up please) that's not considered malware..but should be! The only way you can uninstall it is to root the phone...and this phone...does not root easily..I've been trying. On to why 3 stars..they talk about the display quality on the Nokia 6...I sent a photo to both phones via gmail and opened them. The one on the BLU was better pixel wise and color wise. (the photo was of me on vacation, and I know how the colors should have looked). They talked about dolby sound on the Nokia 6. The Blu has a single speaker on the rear of the phone and the Nokia has two really small speakers on the bottom. I opened sound cloud on both via wifi..played the same song..and the nokia was barely louder and a tad clearer...was not impressed. There are no indication lights on the nokia..charging..completed charging..phone message...nada...my fault for assuming it would. The Blu does have indication lights that can be turned on or off. The camera on the Nokia is a little better, but not by much. Understand..the BLU is my first android phone. I've been a Nokia user for years. From when they had their own OS, to when they went to windows. My older Nokia has a better camera than either the BLU or the new Nokia. The Nokia does look and feel premium more like a flag ship phone, where the BLU feels and looks like a mid range phone, but I'll take function over form any day. I can't comment on phone reception quality because I'm waiting on a nano sim card for the Nokia. I will update after I get the sim. But for now...this Nokia 6 has not impressed me. 1;	-0.1	8.1
B071ZDQ6MV	3	I like that the phone has two SIM slots I bought this phone after my Nexus 5x died unexpectedly after 2 years. It's a decent Nexus 5x replacement although noticeably slower. The Nexus 5x was $350 and I couldn't justify buying a Pixel 2 for $650, especially when phones are designed to last 2 years max. I like that the phone has two SIM slots, one that can be used to expand memory, although I have yet to use this feature. The fingerprint reader works well and the speaker quality is good. The camera is not great. The rear facing camera has a lot of distortion. But I've never had an Android phone that had a good camera, so this isn't surprising. I like that the fingerprint reader is in the front and doubles as the home button. Battery life is good and charging is quick. Definitely the slowness is an issue. I have disabled animations and limited apps that can run in the background but still the phone can be annoyingly slow at times. The most annoying issue is that it will frequently misread a press of the app switch button as a long press and go into split screen mode. There doesn't seem to be a way to disable split screen mode in the Android settings, which is unfortunately because I have never wanted to use this feature. 1;	0.0	7.0

B071ZDQ6MV	3	I'm so disappointed with this smartphone due to WIFI issue. 8/30/17 Update I'm changing my rating to 3 stars. Doing a full reset to factory settings did fix the WIFI issue. The phone really is not bad despite the WIFI issue. I think the WIFI issue is caused by the latest security patch for Android Nougat. I just need to find a way how to disable the security patch from being automatically applied. I don't know if disabling the auto update of applications from Google Play does it. I'll see what happens in the next few days. If I encounter the same WIFI issue again due to Android updates I'll lowering rating back to one star and returning my unit. I just can't keep on resetting my unit to factory settings to fix the WIFI issue. If HMD/Nokia is reading this review. *** Please fix this software issue ASAP. **** I'm so disappointed with this smartphone. It worked well for a few days and now WIFI will not work. I tried all recommendations, except for factory, I saw from other reviews. Nothing worked. 1;	-0.3	6.5
B071ZN4K8V	3	I WILL UPDATE THIS REVIEW AFTER THREE MONTHS HAVE GONE BY As of right now, this phone was a real hassle to get to work, but has been performing phenomenally. Other buyers said that their phone was damaged or had prior scratches when they received it, that didn't happen in my case, the phone looks great. However, trying to get this phone to work with Sprint was a nightmare. It took me two days with customer support to get absolutely nowhere, and in the end they continued to tell me different problems with adding the phone. DO NOT go to Sprint support for this phone. Instead, go to Best Buy to get it done for you. The person there was able to activate it in 15 minutes for Sprint, and actually spoke English. Another reviewer had similar problems with Sprint, and anyone reading should look at his review for a detailed explanation on how to get your phone running, he was a godsend. However, that's not my real gripe. I should have read the reviews closer before purchasing, but many other users said that after the 3 month warranty ended, their phone became glitchy and didn't work anymore. This is unacceptable for something charged at over $200, and I can't recommend you buy this phone at all since there is a chance that this will happen. I will change this review to be 5 stars if the phone retains it's quality after 4 months or so, but until then I would avoid this seller. 1;	0.0	6.7
B071ZN4K8V	3	Good Value, Reliability Questioned. I ducked on offer and after two months of daily use (8 am to 3 pm) and I can't tell you that the battery life is best - it scarcely lasts for 7 hours on Wifi (Spotify, phone, telegram). Not only battery did outperform; the phones heats up fast when updating some apps on Google Play. Visually the device came with slight signs of wear, particularly in the charging area.

I really liked the LED light on the top, as well as the built in games. The quality was good on first impression, and the clicky buttons felt responsive. I did not like the arrow pad very much, though. The directions felt vague when I pressed them. Nevertheless, I was looking forward to using the phone daily. But unfortunately, in Wilmington, Delaware, most 2G cell towers have been switched off. I thought this phone might support 3G networks, but it does not. So, I had to deduct two stars.

B075FKVJV3	3	Does what it needs to. It does what you need a smartphone to do, it just does it very, very slowly. Excellent build quality and amazing battery life. We were promised Android 8 months ago and it is still stuck on 7.1. Meanwhile some other Nokias are on the short list for Android 9. At this point I doubt it will ever be updated, if they actually cared about keeping their promises they would have either released 8.1 by now or officially stated it's not possible. Like I said, it does what it's supposed to do and will probably last a long time, just don't expect too much from it. 1;	0.0	2.8

B075FL4H89	3	Connectivity issues I bought this phone for my dad that didn’t want a smartphone and I also couldn’t find a flip phone that’s durable. I was kinda hesitant to buy it because of the reviews about signal and connectivity issues. But since it’s Nokia, I looked the other way and purchased it. Wrong move. I should have listened. He only used it for a few months and had trouble with receiving and making calls since day one. Most of the time, we couldn’t hear him at all. He had to make 3-4 calls for us to hear his voice, whether or not he’s on the car or just at home. We thought it’s his carrier but we had the same carrier for over 10 years and never had a connection problem. Now my dad is back to his old flip phone. I think Nokia still make good products it just so happens that they did a bad job with this modernized model of 3310. 1;	-0.1	3.8
B075FL4H89	3	Not data compatible I really like a lot of things about this phone (size, color, simplicity... it’s a real conversation starter!) However, it is not data compatible with at&t where I live. I don’t want a smart phone, so I don’t mind not having a browser or apps. But without data it cannot send or receive photo messages or even group texts. (I spent HOURS on the phone with at&t to no avail). I’m pretty sad about it. Also, I don’t think the battery is much better than my previous phone. And it doesn’t have a notepad, which I miss from previous phones. 1;	-0.1	3.3
B075FL4H89	3	ATTENTION US SHOPPERS Please be aware, this phone is a 3G phone. It is incompatible with the Verizon network and many others. Most providers will be leaving the 3G format for 4G with the next year or so. Be aware of whether your network is CDMA or GSM. Do not simply rely on or ask Nokia or your carrier. I asked Verizon explicitly. I asked Nokia explicitly. Both told me that the phone was compatible. I spent the money, got the phone, and went to my Verizon store to be told that it was not compatible. Most carriers should have a list of compatible phones available. PLEASE consult that before buying. If you wish to call first, call three times. 1;	-0.1	2.2
B075FL4H89	3	Best Useless phone out there! I was super excited when I found this phone. It was perfect for my 12 year old daughter who “needed” a phone but didn’t have all the social media capabilities attached to it. It was even her favorite color! Unfortunately is is 3G and carriers no longer support 3G. It’s basically useless if you have AT&T or any other carrier that has long since abandoned that network. Back to the drawing board looking for a “dumb phone”. 1;	0.0	2.7
B075FL4H89	3	Not fully compatible with Cricket Wireless? I liked the overall feel of this phone and the basic-ness of it, but I could not figure out how to receive group messages or pictures. I tried everything possible, but perhaps it is not fully compatible with Cricket Wireless. 1;	-0.2	1.8
B075FL4H89	3	Not what I had hoped Acceptable battery life and durability, however, clunky UI makes it difficult to navigate menu. I got this for my elderly father and he has a lot of trouble figuring out how to do basic tasks and I have to agree. I am fairly tech savvy and it's even a struggle for me. I used to own the old school candy bar Nokia and it was nothing like this. I think the build quality is fairly good but I don't recommend this phone for elderly folks due to the annoying, complicated user interface. Price should be more around $30 for what you get. Service works well on AT&T. 1;	-0.2	2.8

This is dealt with on youtube videos (search youtube for \""\""Note not charging dead battery issue\""\"" - William's video). Problem is the phone won't start charging if the battery is completely dead. The fix: basically you put the phone on an inductive charger and it will begin charging - then you plug it into the USB c charger and it will continue to charge. Problem solved. (You basically have to \""\""kick start\""\"" the charging with inductive charger whenever the battery goes fully dead.) The VolDown+restartButton doesn't fix that (factory reset  etc.). It's charging now and starts OK - will keep you posted. Update: activated phone today and it seems to work perfectly.

Also, not a fan of the rounded edges. When using this phone with one hand your palm presses on the screen selecting something you didn't want, or typing something you didn't want. Annoying! Also, the services sucks! But, that could be my provider (AT&T). I use it with straight talk with an AT&T sim card. I wish I could use the Verizon sim card with this phone. The camera rocks!

Additionally, the phone's screen does not appear to be as responsive compared to other Pixel 2's I've used and came with a number of scratches, possibly not OEM by the look & feel of it.

B079Z792J7	3	works but has design issues This phone is great for kids, not so much for me. I bought one when my iPhone conked out, because we had bought one for our 14-yr-old son for Christmas and it's working well for him. I didn't want to pay the Apple premium so I bought another Moto for myself. The price is right, and everything works, but the placement of the buttons that control sound are right next to the home button, and I'm constantly fussing with the ringer and media volume. Often, I accidentally turn off the ringer, and then I miss calls and texts even though the phone is sitting right next to me. I work from a home office and my phone is my professional lifeline. I can't keep missing calls. Also, no matter how I set up the notification settings for things like texts and WhatsApp, I either don't get notices or I get every notice very loudly. There doesn't seem to be an in between. I really miss the Apple features like the sound-off switch and home button, and even though I've used this Moto for a few months now, I just can't seem to make it work for my needs. Maybe it's user error, but I'm pretty smart and I think it just has design flaws that interfere with how I need to use a phone. I finally ordered a new iPhone and will gladly relegate this to the 'back up' pile in case we lose or break a phone.

I own a Moto G4, also purchased from Amazon, which does not have this problem (which is why I purchased the G6), and I wonder if the problem is in the G6 software or the hardware, but whereever it is, it's a serious flaw unless you have no plans to use Bluetooth.

B07B81WJRQ	3	A great compact phone with a few design flaws I really wanted to like this phone, the 1080P screen, though not OLED, is very sharp and color accurate. It is easy to hold, but the 5 inch display on this phone just feels off to use, it is way to narrow. The Sony ROM is pretty good, not many bloat like the typical Samsung. The phone is snappy, since it is a flagship. There are a lot of good to this phone, but the few minor flaws just defeats the purpose. There is no headphone jack which is not a big deal for me, as I use wireless headphones anyway, but with the not slim body, I don't see why not have one. The fingerprint sensor is at a very low position, i have touched the lense many many times. The volume rocker is very good, but at a weird place again, because the power button no longer is a fingerprint sensor, i kept hitting the volume down button thinking it was the power button. The stereo speakers are not nearly loud enough, i had to keep it on max volume while trying to watch Netflix. 1;	0.1	3.6
B07B81WJRQ	3	Feels cheap I returned this phone and bought a Galaxy S8. I wanted a small phone, which is why I initially went with this one. It just felt cheap in my hand and weirdly thick. My previous phone was a Galaxy s6 and I found myself missing Samsung. This just didn't have a high-end feel to it, I didn't enjoy using it. 1;	-0.4	2.6
B07BFCFDXG	3	Small glitch The phone was received in perfect condition and looks new. I added service to it by Total Wireless ( Verizon) and all worked well except for picture messaging. I worked with Total Wireless's tech support trying to fix it on numerous occasions and ultimately it was found to be a glitch in the phone. I then took it to a local cel phone repair shop and after about 45 minutes they were able to troubleshoot and fix my phone. It works perfectly now. I am requesting Mobile Stream to credit me the repair bill of $32.10 which seems reasonable as the phone had a problem. Hope it all works out. 1;	0.1	3.6

B07C5HH17G	3	Good phone. bad Customer service Really liked the phone but I was expecting the phone to charge faster. It takes 3+ hours to charge completely. I thought I had a defective phone. When i contacted the seller and asked about the fast charging, they told me to contact the phone manufacturer. They were trying to avoid helping me solve the issue. I had a lot going on and didnt have the time to return the phone. Pros: Phone doesnt lag and works pretty good for the price Fingerprint and Face unlock works really well Screen quality is good Cons: Camera is not that great. Had a Xiaomi Mi5s before and the camera was so much better. Does NOT support 5Ghz wifi network Will need a case if you like fingerprints on your phone Takes way too long to charge!! 1;	-0.2	6.4

B07C65VV3R	3	Few minor issues but that is to be expected when buying a cheap refurbished phone. The phone I got was really solid for the price. Only came with a few minor issues. The left side of the screens edge isn't really responsive it will respond but only after a couple of repeated taping and the charging port seems to have a minor issue were it will disconnect but reconnect a split second later after moving the phone around to much while it's charging. I've got to say it's really good and nice especially for the price but the side issue is a deal breaker for me sadly because of the games that I play, do rely heavily on the left edge of the screen.

B07C65XFBB	3	Minor crack and battery usage problems Bought with a brand new S9 to compare the results with this one and was quite disappointed at the reduced battery life likely due to a replaced battery and the screen had a very faint crack from edge to edge at the very bottom.

B07CB315Y7	3	Broke after 3 months I love this model of phone. It's so fast and it has so much storage. The cameras are fantastic. The price was reasonable. But then the touch screen went crazy, stopped responding, and started putting in all kinds of phantom words and letters. And then I got the big shock. I tried to bring it to several different cell phone repair shops and not a single one said they could fix it. The said it's not a US model, and therefore it's not supported in the US and they can't get parts. I spent an hour or so with the very helpful Huawei representative, who helped me find a way to get the IMEI number since I couldn't actually use the phone to find it. He traced the phone to Canada, and said my best bet would be to send it to a phone repair place there. That may have been possible, but every place I found that services these phones charge at least $200 plus shipping. I have to say that I have never had such a helpful service representative anywhere, ever. Kudos to Huawei for that. Finally I decided to order a replacement on Ebay, I found a refurbished model that is identical to this one, and it was $209, which was less expensive than getting it fixed. It also offered a service plan, so if it breaks and no one can fix it, I can get it replaced. I was also able to get a replacement screen kit that came with a toolkit to replace it myself. Buyer beware. It's a great phone, but they do not support this model in the US. 1;	0.1	8.9
B07CB315Y7	3	Get the Pro While this phone is nice in many ways, I beleive the Pro version is the real deal. This one can have some app slowdowns and I had facebook and facebook messenger crashing and locking up time to time. The battery life is surprisingly good, the pictures are very very good. It beats - hands down- my iphone X' shots, yes, believe it! On the other hand, there are some issues regarding the software. It will not take just any other launcher if you happened to not like EMUI interface, Id's say stay away from Huawei if you prefer Google stock-like launchers. Overall, it's a solid mid-range phone, but after trying out the 20Pro, this phone feels slow and subpar. 1;	0.2	4.0

B07CLT3BDN	3	Everything I thought I wanted I spent 3 months researching phones before settling on this purchase. my choices were the Oneplus 6, Zenfone 5z and the Samsung galaxy s8. I settled one the zenfone 5z because it had everything i thought i wanted. This phone is nearly perfect with lots of memory, no lag time and lots of storage. The screen is large and watching vids is pleasant and easy on the eyes. The charging is fast and the battery life is fantastic. i cant go through an entire days of work and never even think about charging. It is by far the best phone that ive ever owned. And then two month after purchasing i dropped it. The one thing i didnt do research completely is the glass backing and screen. One the very first drop the screen shattered. Because the phone is so new trying to find someone to fix it has been a hassle. I dont regret my decision but i do regret not taking seriously the design flaw of glass phones. They are literally created to fail. Who will not drop a phone once? So, now im waiting for someone to order a screen from China, smh. If I can't replace the screen I'll just cell the phone at a loss and start my search for a new phone all over again. 1;	0.0	9.1

B07FMPVBQR	3	Might be a good fit for some people, but not me. No headphone jack... which means you can not use a wired headphone or hook this to your car stereo without using the USB dongle. If you use the dongle, the phone can't be charging. That might be fine for some people but it does not meet my needs. When I plugged the phone in to charge and turned it on and connected it to my Wi-Fi and started downloading its update information, Google Drive kept crashing. There was nothing I could do to stop it. I would clear the pop-up notification and it would immediately reappear, making it very difficult to enter information for other apps that needed input. I have absolutely no doubt that if you deleted Google drive from the phone and reinstalled it from the Play Store it would have fixed the problem. However, I just did not have time to mess around with the phone to correct something that shouldn't have been a problem to begin with. The charger that came with the phone was European spec. Taped to the outside of the box was a US outlet adapter. An absolutely horrible setup for a a serious phone in the US. While the phone does come with 64 GB of of internal storage, as all of my apps were downloading from Google Play Store, the phone reported there was not enough internal storage space to install. Checking the phone's storage, it reported only 27% in use. To make matters worse, there is no ability to add a memory card. There is no external slot for memory. That was really the deal-breaker for me. If I couldn't install all the apps I had on my prior phone with less storage, then something was definitely wrong with this phone. As the headline suggests, this might be a really good phone for some people but it was too much of a hassle to get up and running for me so I returned it. 1;	-0.4	10.1

B07FZHHQB8	3	Great Phone. Samsung Can Do Better. This is one of the best phones I've ever owned, especially from a hardware standpoint. However, Samsung can do so much better. Samsung tries too hard to shove their software and features down our throats and makes it hard to disable things we don't need and sure don't want. Case in point, Bixby. I'll never use Bixby yet I kept accidentally activating it by pressing the Bixby button. Samsung won't let you disable the Bixby Button anymore but they will let you reprogram it to require two presses instead of one to activate. But, they require you to have a Samsung account before they will allow you to make this change. A Samsung account is not needed to use this phone otherwise and I resent Samsung trying to force me to have an account. Another example. I don't want or need anything to do with Yahoo or CNN on my phone, yet Samsung gives them a presence in Edge Panels. If someone wants them, allow them to be downloaded but they should not be installed out of the box. Another example. Samsung pre-installs Facebook on their phones some of which are not allowed to delete Facebook. Even on those phones where you can delete Facebook, there are Facebook processes that run in the background and send data to the mother ship on a regular basis. Stop it! Note to Samsung: Give us options with these phones. By all means, install all of the Samsung software and features that you think will make the phone better. But, make it easy for us to turn them off and to replace them with other software that we might like better. I suspect your sales would increase with this approach. The basic knock on Samsung throughout the web is your bloatware. You can do so much better. If you really want to improve your sales, consider this: Offer your phones as I've described them above but also offer a version of the same phone with pure Android. Your hardware is awesome and by taking the step to offer pure Android, you will immediately make customers of the geeks out there who want to customize their phones. You should even consider allowing phones to be easily rooted for those uber geeks who just can't leave well enough alone. And finally, timely OS software updates are important. You could make them happen so much sooner by giving up the complication of your software overlay. I just want a phone that makes my life easier and doesn't make me cuss. Mission accomplished on the first of those two criteria. Not so much on the second. 1;	0.0	12.7

This is my third time RMAing the phone, and this time the charge port stopped working. It has been two weeks since the repair facility received it and I haven't received word back as to when the phone will be repaired, but if it were to be my guess, never. ---Previous Review--- The size makes it easy to handhold, the camera works, but doesn't offer optical stability, only electronic (which is useless), and most importantly the screens on this phone are terrible. I had to RMA this phone twice. The first time it was for a dead pixel. This second time is for the entire half of the screen giving me dead pixels. It has occurred to me that this Nokia branded phone is not what it use to be and instead became the complete opposite as their screens are fragile and will stop working for no reason. I'd do almost anything to get my robust Nokia from the 2000's back, but it's still ringing somewhere in the world buried in a plastic graveyard. Battery life is good though, at least that's one thing Nokia today can... stand-by. 1;	-0.2	7.2

B07HD2X91Q	3	"Ok but with some annoyances and poor battery life \I got this phone more to try out the new Nokia brand more than anything else. It's an OK phone but just that. The main issues I have with it are a really bad battery life. Basically 13 hours with 3 hours screen on time according to Gsam battery monitor pro. The fingerprint sensor is not responsive and can often take a few goes to work. I heard comments about the high quality case. Honestly it just feels light and plastic, not 'expensive' looking and not the quality I was expecting. A really big issue for me is with Google. They put an \""\""at a glance\""\"" area at the top of the home screen along with a google search bar at the bottom of every screen. You cannot remove either short of installing a different launcher. I mean really google? It's my screen space and I want to have what I want there not your annoying things taking up MY real estate space. I guess the freedom of android customization is going away  google shall have what google wants. The USB C connector can also be a pain when you are set up for everything else micro USB;"""	-0.2	5.7
B07HD2X91Q	3	Good phone but need a replacement after 2 days... This is a decent phone. It certainly feels like the $249 phone that it is, but it is $249. Not super responsive, but definitely passable. Super easy setup with usual Android quirks. But the first one is being returned after 2 days use. Not sure what is going on but something inside seems to be swelling up and popping the back panel off the phone. Looks same as battery issue on old iPhone I had years ago. This phone runs pretty hot too, so not sure what to think. Amazon is shipping me a new one since it is a good phone and quality issues sometimes happen. We'll see how next one goes... 1;	0.1	5.4

B07HK4JNV1	3	Great finger print feature but going brand next time Overall good phone and the fingerprint feature is very accurate, even picking up a partial print when I only have one hand to work with. But it sometimes doesn't receive calls when a T-Mobile brand would and is constantly dropping the wifi connection. The alerts get annoying and I can't silence them. I'm going to ride this phone out till it breaks but next time I'll probably spend the extra money for a brand phone. 1;	0.0	1.6
B07HKPBTVV	3	"Not for me \If you're coming from Galaxy like me, you're probably not going to like Google's UI - it seems very cumbersome and cheap. Your app drawer is just one long page of apps that you swipe up through. The stock messaging app is terribly unreliable. I felt like I went back in time because I found myself in the app store trying to find a SMS app that would actually send and receive my pictures and messages. It's been telling me to restart the phone to finish installing Android 9 since day one. Doesn't matter how many times I actually do that, it doesn't change anything. I can't get it to properly pair with my Galaxy watch and my voicemail (at&t) won't work with it. I have to go of school and call my own number to check my messages and press 7 to delete (remember that? 😆) because any other route gets me a \""\""this number is no longer in service\""\"" message.

B07HKPMFZ5	3	"not as good as iphone XS \I bought the refurbished one and only spent 2/3 of the money so it worth the money. Issues: 1. It turns slow after using for a few days. Some soft keys, e.g. back, input method switch doesn't work well. I need to hit multiple times. 2. Sometimes Google Assistant was automatically launched. Was it spy on me? 3. At the beginning, when the battery reaches 1%, I still can use it for 2 hours. But after 2 months, the phone auto turn off when battery is 2%. 4. Why the camera keep \""\""motion on\""\"" by default? Does it use extra memory? Personally I dislike that feature. It took me a long time to figure out how to turn that feature off. Good points: 1. I love the theme change at 10pm and 11:30.

The phone was sent to me with low battery, thought nothing of it. Till I attempted to charge it, it would not exceed 85%.

B07K4V35TJ	3	"Would buy new next time \The phone was broken, the front microphone was not working when we got it. It took a couple days to figure it out but after we did I contacted the seller for help. They responded very quickly and told me I could either return it to them for another \""\""renewed\""\"" one or take it to the Apple store since it was still under warranty. We took it to the Apple store. They looked at it and did some diagnostics right in the store and the phone self reported that the microphone was broken. Dealing with Apple was horrible - in short it took 2 months  3 trips (7 hours total) at the the Apple store before we had a phone that worked. The renewed cellular people were nice and quick to respond but the fact that the phone self reported a broken microphone and they still sold it is upsetting. This phone should not have been sold and they could easily tell it was not fixed (the \""\""scan\""\"" took 2 minutes in the store). I can't hold the horrible experience at Apple against this seller but from Apple I got a new phone and I didn't want to take the chance on another renewed one from the seller - as it was obvious their check is not thorough.

B07KX73JJL	3	Screen is scratched I was excited by the reviews of this phone that said they received the phone and it looked brand new. I was not so lucky. About 2/3 of the screen has scuff marks on it. You can feel the grooves when you run your finger over it. I was very disappointed, but as the description says, from over 12 inches away you can's SEE the marks. Unfortunately, I can FEEL them. So I put a screen protector and case on it and that helps a lot. Other than the cosmetics of the phone, it works great. It was very easy to set up and transfer my sim card and all my apps. If it weren't for the scratches on the glass, I would have definitely given a 5 star rating. 1;	0.0	5.7
B07KYGHQ1X	3	Non-Standard Charging cord Just set the X4 up, but think I will like it overall HOWEVER -- something that was not mentioned anywhere in the description is that the end of the charging cord that connects to the phone is not standard size, but slightly larger.

B07L14D7F7	3	Hot spot The phone is over all super great, I just had a problem with it and I had to returned it, the reason why I returned it was, because I use the hot spot a lot and I noticed something on the phone, every time I use the hot spot, it cut the data from the phone, so if I was using the hot spot, I coudn't use the internet from the phone.

The bloatware stinks because, as a US citizen, I cannot sign up for Huawei - there isn't even my country on the drop down. This really does sadden me. I brag on Huawei all the time.

B07N6N7JP3	3	Horrible reception but otherwise good phone For the positive parts, it's an attractive phone, the display is gorgeous and the camera quality is great, but the biggest drawback seems to be that it's horrible at picking up a signal. In places where my last phone would get 2 to 4 bars, this one gets none. It makes it extremely difficult to use while at work or at home, because I get no service with it at all whereas I had no issues with any of my other phones prior. I'm still on the fence about returning it, but that is a serious issue because it makes the phone effectively unusable. 1;	-0.4	2.3
B07N7M7VBV	3	Defective phone I will be returning the phone as soon as i have a phone to use. The phone worked ok for about two weeks. After that I started to have problems. It started by no dial tone for about 45 minutes where it did not dial any number I called. Then the volume will switch from high to low on its own.

B07N91S9MW	3	Problems sending texts I've had problems sending texts, but I'm doing this inside a building with a lot of metal. I think it shouldn't be this much trouble, especiallly since I try sending texts near a large window on the first floor. Dropped calls, which I haven't experienced for years. It could be the carrier, T Mobile, which doesn't thrill me. When it works correctly, the phone is super fast. I like the size. If I knew I would be having problems with this unlocked device, I may have gone to another brand. However, I may switch carriers later and see if everything improves. Everything else works great. Good size, beautiful finish, fingerprint works well, but facial recognition doesn't come up when I thought it would. Battery is no good, I have to charge 2-3 times a day. I may have to try to disable some apps. 1;	0.0	5.3
B07N91S9MW	3	Good phone with connectivity issues Overall the phone is very nice and high quality, but I sometimes have missed calls due to lack of connection. My phone always says that I have signal and I have wifi calling enabled for my home but sometimes I'll get voicemails for calls that never got through or i'll try to make a call and it will never start ringing despite having full signal. If I turn on and off airplane mode it fixes the connection issue.

The box contained the phone, a lightning cable, a charger and a sim eject tool. The phone also came with a glass screen protector already installed. Pulling the phone out of the little clear plastic bag and looking over it carefully, it was flawless, no scratches, scuffs or anything it looked very much new. After I set the phone up I decided to check the battery health and capacity as in the description for the amazon refurbished phones ,it says the battery health may be around 80%.

B07P6Y8L3F	3	Basically new with 0 signs of wear Edit: unfortunately I've had to send the phone back as it seems to be having battery issues. The battery indicator would sometimes not update when charging and sometimes seem stuck until I restarted the phone. Sigh, oh well. I was a bit skeptical about buying a refurbished phone but I decided to give it a try. My phone came from the seller Chubbiestech. The box contained the phone, a lightning cable, a charger and a sim eject tool. The phone also came with a glass screen protector already installed. Pulling the phone out of the little clear plastic bag and looking over it carefully, it was flawless, no scratches, scuffs or anything it looked very much new.

B07P8MQHSH	3	Not As Advertise As an Android user the Google Pixel XL was the next phone to get and remain with Androids. I'm disappointed with the battery, it charges to slow.

B07PPZQHPV	3	I LOVE Sony phones with good LTE band. Soon after complete charging and switch T-Mobil sim card from my old Sony Xperia A1 Ultra, I found that, I lost my time, weak LTE, only one bar signal. Camera is not the best. I am going to continue using my Xperia A1 Ultra. 1;	0.1	1.5
B07PV68K73	3	It's ok but not great I really wanted to like this phone. The camera is pretty good quality. The display is really nice as well. The size is definitely light and not that bulky for such a large display phone.. The drawbacks.. the color is misleading. I ordered black and it's not even close to black. It's more of a rainbow purple. The fingerprint reader is Awful. I would say it works maybe 30% of the time. That alone is beyond aggravating because most of my security is set up with using a fingerprint. Although this is a unlocked phone it's far from free of spam. You will constantly get hit with Samsung pop_ups to start using some gimmicky app they offer. The phone also kept asking for permission about updating the Samsung apps etc. I guess I was just spoiled by my first gen pixel xl. They gave me a full refund no issues there. 1;	-0.1	8.4
B07PV68K73	3	NOT a high end phone. I bought this to replace my galaxy s8 because my eyesight is not what it use to be and i wanted a larger screen. So far, here is what i found: The screen is good. Not great but good enough. Copying my stuff from the S8 to the A50 was easy. Note that the required cable to connect the 2 phones together was NOT included. Fortunatly i had one. I have also noted that the phone is not as snappy as my S8. This phone has no wireless charging, no notification LED, and no NFC. It is cheap and I should have suspected this. Battery life is yet to be determined. I will update as time goes by..assuming I keep it. 1;	0.0	3.8

It was just not feasible to use this phone as a daily driver so I am returning it.

B07PY52GVP	3	Great phone until...earpiece sound was lost I've had this phone for about a month and hav been using for about 3 weeks now. The picture quality and battery life are great! The phone came with a European type charger as these phones aren't designed to be sold in the US yet. Two days ago I made a call to my wife while we were both at the supermarket. I called her to find her in the store. I could hear he voice fine. Yesterday, I received two calls back-to-back and thought the sound in the earpiece was gone completely or that I may have accidentally set the phone to mute. Turns out there was sound but it was so faint that I couldn't possibly make a call. I tried the speaker function and it worked well. I haven't yet tried hooking up a headset/earbuds to try that function. Here is the kicker, I tried contacting support and the title in the chat window states US support yet they said they do not have technical support for the US. They gave me an email that I sent a message to and I'm now waiting for a response. So, basically, I'm saying that currently Mi (Xiaomi Redmi Note manufacturer) states they have no US support but can sell phones in the US and that I have no usable earpiece function after less than one month use. 1;	0.0	5.3

B07PY52GVP	3	Excellent value, great phone... with a few caveats. I've had the Note 7 for a couple weeks, and here are my observations thus far. Please note that this review was originally glowing, but was edited after some trouble. The Good: *The Camera - excellent. Probably the best camera I've used on a smartphone, especially a budget smartphone. *Battery Life - With very heavy use, this phone lasts all day with battery to spare. With minimal use, two days is no problem. *Overall Performance - This phone runs games apps very efficiently, and is very snappy. *Value - For the price paid, this phone is an incredible value. I find it to be one of the best phones I've owned overall. The Bad: *Bad SMS app - The default text messaging app is poor, in my opinion. Particularly if you engage in group texts... If you receive a 'group text', it gets divided out into individual messages, and you can't even see who all received the message unless they reply back. This is a limitation of MIUI from what I understand.... However, there is a workaround. I downloaded a free app called 'Textra' to replace the stock SMS app, and it works flawlessly so far. In fact, I like this app so much that I might start replacing my stock sms apps with it from now on. EDIT: This app, after a couple weeks, either becomes ad-supported or you can purchase it to keep it ad-free. *Cell reception problems - I've added this as an edit, and its a BIG deal. This phone is having some issues with cellular reception, particularly when its left sitting for a while (i.e. at night when I'm sleeping). I discovered this while on call for my work. I missed several important calls, and never knew anyone was trying to reach me. Upon finding out via email that people had been trying to reach me, I checked the phone... It showed a couple bars of service, but when I tried calling out it said 'no network available' or some equivalent of that. After a reboot, I could make (and receive) calls again... but not until the reboot. This happened multiple times during my on-call week, and caused me grief at work. I have to say... even with all the cool flagship level features of this phone (and there are many), I can't use it if the most basic part of a phone doesn't work right. This is affecting my livelihood, and it looks like I'll be trying to return it. It is a shame, because other than that it is a GREAT phone for the money :( Sadly, after finding that the most basic phone functionality is flawed, I'll be attempting to return this device. If anything changes, again I will update. 1;	0.0	17.1
B07PY52GVP	3	Great phone with some exceptions. I bought this because it is dual sim and was supposed to work with Verizon. It doesn't. It also will not connect to my computer. I have downloaded the latest USB driver and tried everything suggested on the web but it will not connect other than Bluetooth. Other than those issues, it's a great phone.

The first one came with a 32gb free sd card, the second one someone took the sticker off the box, opened the box and removed the sd card, i have both boxes in front of me and the second one you can clearly see where they peeled the free 32gb sticker off the box, everything else was in the box though.

So, that your fingers will not reach the sensor easily most of the time( I have pretty big hands and long fingers, I play guitar). Then you need to use pattern lock. Back to zero.

B07QV2JKGQ	3	It's alright. I suppose for it's price it isn't bad. The resolution (pixel density) is rather noticeably pixelated and are a bit hard to ignore. The width of it is pretty nice and so is the thin edges around the screen. Unfortunately, the phone seems to be incapable of capturing 4G LTE T-Mobile band, but rather just LTE. The speed of the phone itself is good and the personalization features are nice. The speaker though, sounds a bit muffled. Also, the phone comes with a ton of extra apps for some reason, even an uninstallable Facebook app (why?), but it does give you an option to disable apps, but seriously, the apps are just wasted storage space. Overall, for about $150 it's alright. Looks cool. 1;	0.0	4.2

B07R7DY911	3	"Should've been great. Plagued with issues \To preface, I came from an Essential PH-1 that I really loved, but the call quality was just atrocious. I was looking for a budget phone (eh, I can't believe $400 is considered cheap for a phone these days, but I digress) that had stock android, which only leaves the Pixel 3A, as far as I know. Problems: Crashing / freezing - I had this happen numerous times, which ultimately led to me returning the 3A. At first it started refusing to come out of lock screen and would just completely lock. Only way out was to try and get recovery mode started. Then it started freezing while in use. Same thing again - recovery mode was the only thing that would work. Bluetooth - BT volume is laughably bad. On the PH-1, my car stereo would be at 25-30 volume. With the 3A, I was at 40-45. Yes, it still works technically. But that is almost maxed out and I'm only at a normal listening level. After googling the issue, it seems to be a fairly common complaint. Annoyances: Stock Android - After using the PH-1 for a few years, I grew to love having complete control over android and was expecting the same from the 3A. It's better than other bloatware loaded phones out there, but there are so many Google crapware apps that can't be uninstalled. Knowing Google's reputation for spying on people and data mining, I can only assume this is why you can't uninstall their apps. If you value your privacy at all, this may not be the phone for you. Good: Battery life - It's true, the battery life is stellar. I would typically get one day out of my PH-1. On the 3A, one day I forgot to plug it in the night before and managed to get through an entire second day. So roughly double SOT of my PH-1. Screen - OLED screen on a $400 phone seems like a great deal. Meh: Build quality - It definitely feels cheap. I get it's \""\""only a $400 phone\""\"" but I'd prefer if a $400 device didn't feel like a tupperware lid. Ultimately  I had to return it. If it's already crashing and freezing in the first few weeks;"""	-0.1	11.2
B07RB78W37	3	Cheap, but you get what you pay for. The 4GB of RAM is good, maybe in this day and age of sloppy code, necessary. The processor speed is good. Storage is great. The famous Verizon network is highly overrated, as all networks are, but that's beside the point. Fingerprint reader was a joke. Took forever to program in my fingerprint. Once it was in it took several times to unlock the phone. Absurd to put something so poorly functioning on the live market. But, by far, the worst thing about this phone is the edge to edge screen is tripped by just holding the phone. You can't hold the phone comfortably without setting off something by accident from your fingers wrapping around the edge. This makes the thing sort of undependable. They need to fix this. They could do it with a system update. I had the original Droid with the slide-out keyboard, the beautifully slim Droid that was fatter at the top with the Kevlar back (my favorite), and the razr whatever it was called, that totally crapped out on me (screen went haywire, then went dark). While mostly functional, the Z4 is starting out with too many eccentricities from the outset to earn a place of distinction amongst previous Droids much less amongst smart-phones in general.

B07WFJ6HRF	3	"Would buy new next time \The phone was broken, the front microphone was not working when we got it. It took a couple days to figure it out but after we did I contacted the seller for help. They responded very quickly and told me I could either return it to them for another \""\""renewed\""\"" one or take it to the Apple store since it was still under warranty. We took it to the Apple store. They looked at it and did some diagnostics right in the store and the phone self reported that the microphone was broken. Dealing with Apple was horrible - in short it took 2 months  3 trips (7 hours total) at the the Apple store before we had a phone that worked. The renewed cellular people were nice and quick to respond but the fact that the phone self reported a broken microphone and they still sold it is upsetting. This phone should not have been sold and they could easily tell it was not fixed (the \""\""scan\""\"" took 2 minutes in the store). I can't hold the horrible experience at Apple against this seller but from Apple I got a new phone and I didn't want to take the chance on another renewed one from the seller - as it was obvious their check is not thorough.

B001AO4OUC	4	tough little phone This phone isn't kidding when it says military specs. I had a hole in my pocket and it went tumbling down a flight of concrete steps (20 steps). It had a few scratches but it worked fine. It also made a few other death - defying leaps. It is VERY drop resistant. That being said, it is not crush proof. It's battery was just about dead so I decided to leave it in the car to charge. I plugged it into the car charger, grabbed my purse, and got out of the car. Unbeknownst to me, the charger cord was tangled around my purse. I stood up and closed the car door - right on this phone. That left a BIG mark - that finally did it in (If it still worked, I would have had the world's first boomerang phone - it looked just like a boomerang afterwards). I just ordered a new one. As much as I beat up my last phone and as well as it fared, I had to get another one. My only pet peeve with this phone is they could have at least given me ONE full game - not the lame demos that are included with it. The phone itself is about the size of a Hershey bar.

The phone is simple and was used only for calling and sending txt messages (it is possible to download some applications, but I did not test it). The phone had no difficulties to find network in California (from LA to San Francisco), battery held approx. for 10 days (phone was always on, but only few calls were made and few txts sent), quality of sound was very good. The phone fell once on the ground from ca. 1 meter and no harm was made (not even a small scratch).

However it Is not without A few aggravating features. The keyboard is small, as others have mentioned, so if you have large fingers it might not suit you. Also, there is now way of deactivating the browser that I am aware of and believe me I've looked for one. The browser is a one button push, and the only defense from doing this is to lock the keyboard by holding down the space button, which I forget to do sometimes. I just learned you can set the phone to lock the keyboard after a time of inactivity, in case you forget to lock it like I do. I was skeptical that this phone only charged you .25 minutes a text that another reviewer mentioned but sure enough it does, although I just noticed it also charges you 1 minute a call whether the person you are calling answers or not, which to the best of my knowledge doesn't happen with other net 10 phones. The mp3 player is a nice feature and can use up to 16 GB of ...which is quite a lot of music. Can't comment too much about the camera save for the fact you cannot zoom in after you snap a photo. Speaker is on par with other cheap phones. I would suggest this phone to anyone who has small fingers that likes to text, additionally they have a very similar phone at Kroger grocery store at the moment if you want to get an idea of the keyboard size. It is a Samsung with slightly different Model numbers. ThE 355c has a very slightly smaller keyboard than the one at Kroger. 1;	0.1	5.0
B004GLQTG8	4	Overall, a solid performer If you want just talk n text on verizon consider this phone. Excellent reception, easy to use keyboard even for my large fingers. Phone has issues of staying silent when going in and out of vibrate mode. I had to reboot a couple times to get the texting sounds back but I don't use silent mode that much. I'd like to say a special thanks to the Shopcelldeals store. I had my phone for almost a month before I opened it. When I did, the battery enclosed inside the packaging was the wrong one! I have had dozens of prepaid phones over the years and never witnessed this before! The battery was about an 1/8 inch too wide. I contacted Shopcelldeals via Amazon and they sent out a correct battery right away, no questions asked. Thank you Shopcelldeals! 1;	0.0	4.7
B004H23JXW	4	Good Start If you are wanting to give a Windows smart phone a try this phone I highly recommend it. It's a nice solid phone. I've had mine for 4 months and I'm still pretty happy with it. The back is plastic with good looking pinstripes and some might complain that adding a certain cheapness to it but I disagree. It still looks great and very easy to remove if necessary and if made from metal would only increase overall weight and probably be a little trickier to remove having to line up slots just right. As it is it snaps off and on with ease. The overall feel is good and solid with nice curved edges making it a good looking phone as well. The 5 mega-pixel camera takes good pics too. The Super-Amoled touchscreen is great and easy to see in almost all light conditions even under a bright sun. The Windows os; as far as I can tell I like it. I can't comment on the Android or ios as I haven't used them. I can only say that what I've read is that Android is a mess. It is by far the most popular and looks like it will be for sometime. It appears that Google has very low if any standards in place for phone manufactures. Many of them with the hardware needed to fully run Android. Windows has placed standards on how Windows phones should be made so they run smoothly with little or no issues and at the same time keeping requirements at a level to keep accessible to most consumers. Most comments I've read about I phones is that while at one time cutting edge are not anymore as their platform is getting stale, have run out of ideas, running on brand only. Windows was designed with the user in mind to have an interface easy and intuitive to use and customizable enough for almost everyone and have become the one with the ideas now. There are some caveats I'd like to point out. The button placement could be better. The lock-screen button is directly opposite of the volume and too easy to press when trying to adjust volume. The light sensor works and locks the screen when making a phone call but not when putting it in a pocket or purse. It won't automatically lock itself leading to pocket calls, pictures of your pocket and voice commands. The only way to prevent this is to remember to press the lock-screen button. One of my fears is this button wearing out fast from having to use it so much. Most of these phones will be AT&T phones so be prepared. They have Windows 7.5 and no plan or talk to release any update. There are several work-arounds to this. One being to plug phone in to computer, start the Zune software, click on phone update under the settings then unplug the internet connection from the computer after 2 or 3 seconds. It's real tricky to say the least and one that I couldn't ever get to work. There is a cab file to download on your computer and do it that way. The easiest is an application called seveneighter that will do the whole thing for you. I used that method a month ago without any problems. I recommend going to the windowsphone subreddit for any help you might need. Samsung has a user manual available on their website with many tips and information not available anywhere else. Windowsphonehacker.com has the seveneighter file that I mentioned to update your phone with great help articles as well. 1;	0.3	19.1
B004H23JXW	4	"good phone after I tweaked it \this phone is awesome, and windows phone 7 is a very stable op system. i love this phone. puts my old nokia e71 to shame, though the nokia is a good phone. HOWEVER, when I received the phone and proceded to update, it wouldn't cooperate i researched the issue on the internet, and it seems to be a common problem turns out that my phone had demo firmware on it well, instead of contacting the seller and going through that mess, i found the retail ROM online. i ended up using a rom sender and switched the demo with the retail, and it updated right away. i can't say if the seller was aware of the demo firmware being on the phone, but be careful if your phone turns the screen on by itself every couple of minutes, chances are you have a demo model. I decided to put a custom rom on it, and it is the best phone I have ever had if you want a custom rom, use keywords \""\""dark forces team\""\"" or \""\""voluptuary\""\"" i have voluptuary's on mine. definitely a good phone for the money  and wp7 is awesome!!!\"";"""	0.2	4.3
B004H23JXW	4	Windows phone Killz* The delivery was stressful, being I paid for EXPRESS delivery and It still arrived at the standard speed.. So that SUCKED!!! Then, packaged was recieved well, brand new, everything included as stated, nothing more, nothing less. At first glance after turning it on and having my network run it, I will admit slight disappointment, being that without its update, the phone is pretty much locked from all it's features; in other words, you will REQUIRE a windows computer with Internet access in order to do its software update. However, once all that is done with, this phone is AMAZING!! I never had a windows phone previous to this one, but I don't think I'll ever go back to Android, Blackberry, nor IOs ever again!!!! Windows is definitly the future!! Am a fully satisfied costumer, though the minus 1star is for the delivery process! 1;	0.0	3.5
B004H23JXW	4	Won't work with all networks!!! Even dough it is a quad-band phone...it won't work with some networks.After I bought it and try to use it in Canada...all networks operate on 1700MHZ (WIND and MOBILICITY) did not work! Very user friendly.....if it works. Ps: Amazon.com were great with shipping. 1;	-0.1	3.1
B004H23JXW	4	Nice screen and camera The phone itself is a little bit too thin to hold. A 4-inch screen is normal today, but I found it a little big for my thumb to touch the whole screen. The three buttons sometimes are too sensitive and it's easy to open up search application accidentally. The battery can only hold for about 12 hours, it is absolutely to buy a extra battery. In a word, it's a average WP7 phone and it's pretty natty if you don't care the amount of apps in windows market. 1;	0.1	2.8
B004H23JXW	4	Honest mistake Purchased two unlocked phones but only one came unlock. Contact seller and received code to unlock phone. After numerous attempts I was able to unlock phone. I am now please with my purchase. I was going to return phone but decided to keep phone. 1;	0.0	1.2

B004H23JXW	4	so much product for so little money have made the switch from an android(galaxy ace 5830) to windows phone and have no regrets. the screen is large and crystal clear. the UI is clean, simple and runs flawlessly. web browsing is fast. moving between web pages, apps, calls, text is so smooth. the only thing i miss about my android is SwiftKey app! call quality and speaker volume are very good. it really needs some king of case because it is very light and slick. the only reason i gave a 4 instead of a 5 is due to the fact i can't send mms. this is because i use a straight talk sim for att. it does not allow mms on older windows phone. excellent value. not a huge issue for me as there are many other ways to share media. i had my android samsung for 1 year and current samsung focus for a week. it is a learning experience and i am getting to like it more each day. battery is longer lasting than my galaxy ace. just wanted to add that amazon has been fantastic. i initially recieved the wrong item from seller. amazon customer service had the correct phone sent out in 2 days and a refund credit given immediately. service above and beyond. 1;	0.3	12.5
B004H23JXW	4	has draw back for straight talk I love this phone, though there are some MAJOR setbacks if one wants it for straighttalk. The picture messaging system does not work, although there is a way around it it is SO troublesome and it took me a month to get everything working correctly, but once it's working the phone is amazing and I have no complaints except a lack of a front facing camera. 1;	0.2	0.7
B004H23JXW	4	-Not sure why people who gave 1 star for not being unlocked Okay, So I ordered my phone from Amazon Warehouse. I got my phone, and learned it was not unlocked; however, if a person were to do a simple google search, there are many instructions on how to do this very easily! To give a product 1 star just because it didn't come unlocked seems very unreasonable. The phone itself is great. I have no contract currently, but using existing wifi I am able to download apps, music, games, and many more things. I only removed one star because it did not come unlocked but I do not feel it should be a score of 1 star. I was able to unlock the phone myself, but I will not give out the instructions, like I said, google is your friend. The phone is responsive and sleek. The plastic is a little cheap, but not by much. The screen can be wiped of finger prints easily. I am going to be getting a screen protector and a case for this phone later on. A lot of the windows games that play on this phone seem to do okay. Some of the real knew games lag a bit but I feel it is still good quality. Because this phone is refurbished, I thought I would get it with some scratches or blemishes. This is not so. It came without any problems! I was very surprised. Amazon Warehouse rules! If a person has the money, get this phone but if you have even MORE money, get an android or apple product because their stores have millions of apps and games while windows is still building theirs. 1;	0.0	7.4

B004YBP8EY	4	"EXTENSIVE review!!!! \Want to start off by introducing myself. I am a 19 year old male who enjoys technology. I am NOT a heavy user (maybe 90 minutes a day using my phone except for 6-8 hours playing music), but I do spend very many hours with a new device learning every nook and cranny of it as quickly as possible. This phone is a very interesting phone. The layout is VERY similar to a smartphone, however it is NOT a smartphone at all. It is what is called a feature phone; one of the smartest and most advanced ones made as of 2013. It feels a bit smallish. To give you an idea of the size of the screen, take a 3X5 index card (the kind with lines) and fold it in thirds (90° angle to the lines). Now … cut off one of the thirds and trim off the top of the card along the red line. This is the exact size of the screen. 2 stars for screen size. It's way too small. The battery life though, probably due in part to the screen size and basic-ness of the phone, is incredible!!!! If you use your phone heavily, as in all day long from 6AM until midnight, you can use it all day without a charge. If you don't use your phone much, it can go MANY days without a charge. I think I have had up to about 4 days on my phone, but I tend to have it running a good bit for music over headphones. 5 stars for the battery life! Here is a list of the built-in features: - texting (conversation layout. Relies on the memory capacity of the phone's built-in storage. If you intend to text on this phone but also have media stored on it too, PURCHASE A MEMORY CARD!!!!! It supports multimedia messages. I am running T-Mobile on it and I have NOT been able to successfully send any multimedia as of yet. I can however receive all of them. This is a carrier problem, not a phone problem. The touch screen keyboard however is very difficult to use. I love touchscreens (I have an iPod touch, an iPhone, and have handled MANY MANY different smartphones. This is the most difficult touchscreen keyboard I have ever used. It can be used but it is difficult and will slow you down. Use with patience. Calibration (at least with this phone) may be off slightly and differs with each key. Small size doesn't help any. It is NOT impossible to use and I have gotten SIGNIFICANTLY better with it over the past month. 3 stars for texting and keyboard. - calling (supports 3+ way calling, however I have never needed to use this feature so I cannot review this feature. Calling is pretty good but not excellent. At times especially at the beginning of a call I can faintly hear my voice with varying lag times, from nearly at the same time, to up to a second behind. 4 stars for calling. - connectivity. Yes it has wifi. It's good, however it will not be anything different than its 3G connection. And it's basic 3G, nothing fancy. Not too fast but works okay. 4 stars for connectivity, both for 3G and wifi - Screenshots!!!!!! :) push the bottom middle button and the power button on the top right side at the same time. - FM radio, a very good one at that. Must use headphones for radio to work. It records too! Excellent quality recordings. Very high quality. What you hear on the radio is exactly what the recording will be. In fact if you use the music player to play back your recordings, it has an audio plack mode called 5.1CH. I don't know what that stands for, but it makes the tones sound deep and rich. I cannot gett over the quality of the output. 5 stars for the radio! - Music player. Exactly the same look and layout of a Samsung Galaxy. It plays much better and significantly louder than almost any other feature phone. I have owned 6 feature phones in my life. This one is the best one for music. 5 stars for the music player! Just be sure to purchase a memory card. - Camera. Rear-facing only. 3.2mp (megapixels), no flash. It's actually pretty good for what it is. Max resolution is 2048X1536. Here is the resolution list in MP settings … 3.2, 2.4, 2, 1.5, 1.3, and 2 for 0.1 mp: 400X240 and 320X240. The camera is highly customizable both before and after the picture is taken. It is full of very very many different editing options (for one who has the time to fish around for the fun of it) but they are all basic in nature. You can change color schemes, sharpen and blur images, even add basic clip art, words, and change font and color of words! It is an absolute blast to play with the camera. 5 stars for the camera!!!!!!! - Web browser. No exaggeration folks, but it stinks. Possibly the worst browser I've ever had. Most sites CANNOT load completely. It says it has run out of memory. The browser is sickeningly depressing. One star. However, it CAN DO YOUTUBE and it operates nicely on that site!!!!! (VERY WEIRD) The audio quality is somewhat poor and slightly garbled, and the videos aren't very clear and they are kind of grainy, but for how poor this browser is, it's shocking that it works!!!! It runs quickly and smoothly. 3 stars for YouTube. - Calculator. Very very good for a feature phone!!!! Comes with many features!!!! You can even scroll through all your old calculations! It is however a European phone and the decimals … are, well, … commas. Kind of different, but not bad! 5 stars for calculator hands-down! Incredible! Dictionary. Lots of words, a few unusual ones, but chances are that if you are a person with a very good education, and you need to reach for the dictionary, you will only find your word half the time. The definitions are broken down into extremely simple terms. EXAMPLE: Complicated: If you say that something is complicated, you mean it has so many parts or aspects that it is difficult to understand or deal with. And then there are examples of uses of the word. 4 stars for dictionary. - Notes. Good for what it is for. Basic. No need to elaborate. 3 stars because of keyboard. - clock, alarm clock, stopwatch, tasks … they all work very well. 5 stars. - calendar. Very good! Lots of things you can do with it. Very much like an iPhone calendar! 5 stars. - have not used twitter Facebook or all that other social media stuff. Cannot write a review on that - email. Plugged in all the correct information and it refused to work on both 3G and on wifi. Phone problem, not carrier or my fault. - Voice memos. Works as good as any other device. They are all almost the same. Records for 12 hours. 4 stars??? I don't know. Hard to say for sure. - Samsung apps and widget store. Blah. Stinks. Very little stuff at all. Most of it can't even be downloaded. Sometimes the very basic site itself can't even load because it says not enough memory. 1 star. - Games. Can download and run any 240X400 J2ME app for touchscreen phones. Expect only the most basic functionality of it though. The best place I have found for these apps is a place called umnet.com. Be sure to do your browsing on the COMPUTER!!!!! This phone can't load that site. There is a download page the phone can use and it is umnet.net instead. Have fun. 4 stars, but keep in mind, it's 4 stars for what it is DESIGNED to do, not for how good it is compared to a smartphone!!!!!! Well that's about it! If you are going to PURCHASE this phone, here are some helpful tips. The phone kind of has TWO DIFFERENT screen formats, each with their own style, format, layout, whatever you call it. When you \""\""slide to unlock\""\"" the first thing you will see is a background with these app-lookin thingies called widgets. These make your phone run heavy  however they can be helpful little tools. These are downloaded from the samsung App Store. These can be added and removed by tapping the widget button on the top left of the screen. A row of app icons will appear at the bottom of the screen. Those are all your widgets. You can scroll through those. To open them;"""	0.1	61.6
B004YBP8EY	4	Great phone This is a great phone. I have had a lot of cell phones but this is my second trully unlocked phone. It is a bit smaller than expected but still a great buy. Capacitive touch screen is as good as any and maybe better than some. The phone memory is not great at all but I use external storage so it matters very little. The touch screen keyboard has a learning curve for those with large fingers. The free hand write mode is fantastic. Only down fall with this phone for me is it is not voice activated and it does not seem to have speed dial. I think that the memory , it being non voice activated and possibly non speed dial should be stated in the description of the phone. I would purchase for a family member or friend 1;	0.3	6.9

The cellphone was running an older version of Windows. Once I upgraded the software, all of the headaches cleared. Pros -Small, light weight -High screen resolution -Intuitive GUI -Universal micro usb for charging Cons - The power button/screen lock on opposite side of vol. You will tend to press both, offsetting your vol (very upsetting) - In order to upgrade the software, you will need a Window 7 computer and load Zune. - For the market to work, you will need to sign in with your Zune account (we do not have) 1;	0.0	3.5

B007X6FFLS	4	it is a phone and thats about it. I just needed a temp phone until my contract expires. I lost my last one but still had an extra sim card laying around. bought this phone and stuck the sim card in, A 5 minute call to ATT had it activated and its worked pretty good so far. Absolutely nothing fancy about it, there is no screen on the outside so that's a little bit of a pain, but it doesn't answer upon opening so you can still screen your calls if you are into that sort of thing. For people who don't see very well or want a very simple easy to use phone this is it... takes all of 3 seconds to adjust any setting, all three of them. no camera is kind of a pain but certainly not a deal breaker.

(not while she is driving, mind you) My dad is usually driving. He refuses to use it. LOL I bought it for them in case they need anything or we need them when they are out and about and we can't get hold of them. We have went thru a couple of phones but no big deal.

I called Virgin Mobile's customer service number and the guy had it working in about sixty seconds. It my name was on this phone, I'd skip the nonsense directions and just list the number. That said, it's been a pretty good little phone, no issues with it, easy to charge and use. If all you want to do is make phone calls, you can't go wrong for the price. 1;	0.0	3.1

Product arrived on time and it was exactly as described. It came in Veriyon box with a travel charger, instruction manual and an online service voucher. We did have problems with finding a matching sim ( micro sim) card in our local stores so we ended up waiting for over a week to get one from verison. The phone mostly works very well. It did not want to charge a few times and once we couldn't shut down the alarmclock off, but those are issues I would bring to the manufacturer.

B00A7F57EM	4	"Nokia Lumia 822 for Verizon- Trying Windows 8.1 Phone \I needed to get another phone as mine was giving me some problems. I had a Windows phone several years ago and liked it but I had a few issues with it and upgraded to an Android phone. After two android phones I thought I might try a Windows phone again with a much better operating version, Windows 8 or 8.1. I bought this phone as a \""\""refurbished\""\"" unit. About two weeks after I received it the USB port failed so I had to buy a QI charging back so I could continue to use the phone (I already had a QI charger). I bought a spare battery at the time of Amazon order to make sure I had at least one good battery available. Overall the the phone had been a good buy. I have also changed to a Windows 8.1 computer some the process was a little easier using the similar OS. I follow the Windows 10 news each week  looking forward to a final public release of W10. I am not sure I will make it to the W10 release before I will want or need to upgrade again. I think Microsoft needs to speed up the release if possible.

B00B2BYU1Q	4	"Wonderful phone didn't work with T-mobile. \I purchased this phone because I was under the impression that it supported the 4G bands necessary to run on T-mobile with data. I received the phone and set up the T-mobile Sim along with the phones set up. So far so good everything working and it was fast! Then after everything was set up I decided to download apps and update the phone, I then enabled WIFI to speed up the process. After the updates and downloads I turned off WIFI to test the speed of the network. Now with my old phone I get 4G speeds \""\""not LTE\""\"" at my house so I was expected the same speed or better. Then I saw in the top left corner it was full bars with a little G next to it which made me exited because I thought the G meant 3g or 4g. But it turns out that G means the step down from Edge. So when I tried using the browser my phone just sat there and gave up before it loaded even Google. And after some more research I found out that the data would only work on T-mobiles \""\""reformed\""\"" networks which are only available in 49 cities. But  for my experience with the phone.

B00B2BYU1Q	4	Sold by Mango Wireless as new: Previously opened package, defective charger Sold by Mango Wireless. Seems in decent shape but the box is unmarked and was opened previously. Splash screen is in Spanish and was originally set to Portugal for the country. The power adapter is for non-United States power outlets. There is a US power adapter included but doesn't fit tightly on the European one, and does not provide power unless manually held in just the right position. Once it's let go, its own weight causes it to shift enough that the connection is broken. The phone itself seems to be in good condition. Although initially tempted to return it I am going to hold onto it for a bit to see how it behaves other than the adapter. This will take awhile since the battery was completely drained and cannot currently charge it except through my computer's USB port. I am very disappointed to get a used device not targeted to the United States, with a defective charger, and a user manual in Spanish. We'll see if the experience improves from here. EDIT: After updating to 8.1 and Googling some things about how to configure the phone, I have it talking to me in my own language and, aside from the initial splash screen, there's nothing to indicate the phone isn't intended for a US English speaker. It did take a couple of days to work it all out, but I have a phone I am very pleased with. I upped the rating to 4 stars, but that is a reflection of the phone itself. I still would only give the seller a couple of stars for sending me a phone that I had to appropriately configure for the correct region. 1;	0.0	6.6

B00CQAOIIC	4	"Nokia Lumia 928 \I've owned this phone for more than a month now & feel it's an excellent product. Very solid and excellent construction. I dropped it twice before I bought a skin/cell case for it without any problems or even scratches. My 1 & 1/2 year old son placed the phone in the microwave for about 10 seconds before I caught him & the only problem I ended up with was a temporary frozen screen. After turning the phone back on, I haven't had that problem any more. Plus my son is not allowed near it now. The screen is large & very clear even in direct sunlight. I like the square shape of it & the numerous color choices to change the theme/tile colors. When I get bored of one color, I quickly switch to another. The camera is of course excellent in both day & night time shots, but the video capture is even better. I have a Sony hand-held video camera that in bright sunlight keeps trying to refocus the lens & half the video comes out blurry. The video on this phone is crystal clear, very bright with vivid colors. My only 2 complaints: 1. I wish there was a \""\""forward\""\"" button  not just a \""\""go back\""\"" one. This would make navigation even easier. 2. And my biggest disappointment is that I can't add strings to phone numbers. With my old ancient phone;"""	0.2	8.8

The camera has crisp clear photos with the ability to use both the front and rear view camera at the same time. I did get 32gb because of the OS space usage the reviews talked about.

B00E92B88I	4	Great phone while it worked. This phone did a great job for a little under a year and then started having some problems. Up until then, this phone handled everything great and still managed it in a small form factor. It's about the same size as the original Moto G, but has a slightly large screen with less bezel. Having just upgraded from a Moto G, I really enjoyed the size change. It also took pretty decent photos (nothing earth shattering) and handled everyday navigating, Reddit browsing, texting, and calls with ease. Was a pretty trouble free phone for a good while, but I wish that would last longer. It started having an issue where it would lock up and then would need to be restarted. Once it was restarted, it would take almost 10 minutes to boot up. Apparently this was a known issue that a bunch of people were having problems with. If you were lucky and didn't get this issue, the phone was great. Especially on very close to stock android, instead of being loaded with bloatware. 1;	0.2	7.2
B00E92B88I	4	... on foreign networks but overall it has been a great phone. Due to language barriers Some difficulties using it overseas on foreign networks but overall it has been a great phone. Due to language barriers, the errors the phone gives me can't seem to be fixed by the mobile phone companies in town. The camera works OK, it was my main reason for purchasing the phone with data & cell service. I think my old HTC takes better pictures with a lower pixel count. It's difficult to adjust the camera settings and it seems to want to ignore screen saving settings. Sometimes it will dim in 15 seconds and other times it will stay on all night. I have done searches and can't seem to find a way to fix this setting or where the conflicting times/programming is located to have it dim & lock quickly to save battery life. It needs to be darkened or it will only last 1/2 day on a full charge. It was much less expensive than other unlocked phones. I find the quirks almost par for the course - I am overseas, with a phone I purchased in the States, on a network and country that has very limited English - I could have waited until I arrived in-country and purchased an unlocked Samsung or Iphone. However, I didn't know what the pricing and options would be prior to my arrival. It's served to be what I needed and seems to be reliable and predictable. 1;	0.0	5.1
B00E92B88I	4	Defective - Network connection issues The phone was packaged and shipped properly and quickly and was in mostly good shape (physically) but the sim card slot was slightly tweaked, and worse, the phone has major network issues. I tested this phone in areas where I know AT&T gets good to excellent coverage and this phone would consistently drop it's signal for sometimes minutes at a time. It also would not even connect to my microcell at home, which I've had no problems with on other smartphones. I took it to an AT&T tech support specialist, who swapped out my sim card, tried different APN settings, and verified my AT&T account was provisioned properly, and his advice was that I return it, because it must be defective. I definitely agree that it was defective. I give the phone one star but the seller 4 or 5 stars for their service and refunding me. 1;	-0.4	4.5

B00E92B88I	4	Two down sides. I purchased the Moto X for my wife. She seems to like the phone and how it functions. Two bad points do exist. I don't believe you can replace the battery so it is a throw away like most everything. Also you cannot add a SIM card for additional memory. This is to force the owner into using Google storage services for those who have extensive music librarys or memory stores. I love my Galaxy S4. 1;	0.0	2.3

B00ECAABBC	4	Great Phone Love the phone. Very response and intuitive. Camera works very well - crisp, clear. More of a zoom would be nice, but very good nevertheless. Only real drawback - wish there were more apps like for iPhone and Android. This is more a windows issue than a Nokia issue. The apps issue is the only thing keeping me from rating it with 5 stars. 1;	0.6	5.2
B00ECAABBC	4	Came with Some Problems But Okay This device came on time (well actually one day late compared to the tracking information) and it worked perfectly. I previously used a Nokia Lumia 521 and this was much faster. I thought I was forever going to hate Windows OS, but I guess not. In addition, since I already had a Lumia, I didn't have to get a new type of SIM card and it was easy to transfer my apps and data. Picture taking on this blew me away, including the option to capture in camera raw, even though I don't use that feature since I am a broke college student that can't afford PhotoShop. Well anyway, the only problem that came up was that on the second day of usage, I noticed a half-inch long scratch or crack on the screen of some sort, probably because I ordered a refurbished one. The only logical explanation for that would be Chuck Norris or because I didn't order screen protectors right away. It also came with what I believe as some residual foundation in between the screen and body. Other than that, I have had no problems and am happy with my purchase. 1;	0.2	6.1
B00ECAABBC	4	Great pics, screen problem I bought this phone for my wife because she wanted to be able to take decent pictures. It does take great pictures and the phone works quite well with plenty of bells and whistles. The only problem so far is that, after just a couple weeks of use, the screen started to separate from the frame behind it. Apparently, this has been an issue with this phone. A local phone repair shop put some adhesive behind the screen and this has fixed the problem, at least for now. 1;	0.3	3.2

B00F2SKPIM	4	VERY Pleased with this phone!! I have had this phone for a little over a month now and am extremely happy with it. I love everything about it EXCEPT the Visual Voicemail Update that WONT GO AWAY. I DO NOT want Visual Voicemail and besides that, Verizon wants to charge 2.99 a month for it!! I won't go into this any further as it will just spark more rants about unwanted software/bloat ware. The problem with this particular piece of crapware is that notifications CONTINUALLY pop up and sit in the notifications bar at the top of the phone. If you clear it, it comes back, and there is no way to turn it off either! This is the reason for taking off 1 star off the phone¡¦s rating. Other than that, the phone is a real performer, takes wonderful pictures and video and is still slim enough to fit nicely in my back pocket. The phone is big, but so are my hands and it could not fit them better. This is truly a ¡§where have you been all my life¡¨ moment having this phone. The larger display is just awesome and the pen works great too. This phone would be a perfect 10+ without the software/bloat ware thing. But hey, where would the world be without annoying salespeople trying to sell you what you don¡¦t want or need? Anyway, the battery life has been great for me. Most times I can go 2 days without a charge. I do turn my phone off at night though and I don¡¦t play games on it with the exception of Bubble Shootº. I went from the Droid Razr Maxx to this phone and I loved that phone, well I thought I did until I got this phone. I was hesitant going away from Motorola equipment, as I have always had some sort of Motorola device because they are made so well. REALLY glad I made this switch!! 1;	0.1	12.2
B00F2SKPIM	4	Just short of perfection Phone is everything previous reviews have noted. More phone than 90% of folks would ever use. One thing that has been a bit of a disappointment has been reception. As some have noted this phone for whatever reason on Verizon , reception is average. I am 2000 ft from my cell tower and have yet to see more than 4 mb down on 4g. When I am closer to other towers I have seen 39mb down on 4G so I know the product is capable. Mind you it is possible that this tower is saturated as I never saw more than 13 mb down on myDroid Razr Maxx. Voice reception has dropped off as well and at times fades out but returns in the same location. Never had that issue with the Razr. Here is hoping that software updates resolve some of it....... Other than that...amazing device 1;	0.0	4.6

But if I had to do it again, I would have opted for the Note 4 because of the camera lens, processing speed, and application quality despite the additional costs. I love the on-screen writing and use it all the time to avoid the other text entry. I get a lot of \""\""Oh my God that's huge!\""\"" when I take the phone out but I also like the larger screen so I don't have to stress my eyes.

B00F2SKPIM	4	AMAZING PHONE This is my first time buying a phone on amazon. I am in love with it and I got $80 off the price Verizon sold it for.They had to verify that I was indeed under contract with them and then I got my phone FOR THE DISCOUNTED RATE OF $219! The ONLY reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the charger! OMG it is faulty and will only charge in an upside down position..but if there is any movement it stops charging..it must be something within the charger itself like a loose wire..cause I use another charger and it charges fine.

B00F9RRVUG	4	Good phone, great price I was looking for a very simple phone after being frustrated with other non-smart phone devices that would suddenly die on me for no reason. Usually, I can blame myself for an issue, but certain phones (cough.... Samsung A187 AT&T Phone) stopped working for no reason! I would have given this phone 5 stars for sure, if weren't for the fact that it has started to act up these last few months (starting around September). It seems to turn off uncexpectedly, but might just be a battery issue, not sure. Otherwise, it works great! I only use it to text and calls. Kinda do wish it had a QWERTY keyboard, but you really can't beat the price! Also, I LOVED the text message chyme it has (it reminds me of another phone I used to have.... but I broke that one, my fault).

B00F9RRVUG	4	all it does is make and receive calls I bought this phone for my husband as he decided he might need a phone for his job. He does a lot of driving and if he had car trouble or got lost without a phone he would have no way to get in touch with the company. He wanted the cheapest, just make a call phone he could find. I couldn't find one much cheaper and about all it does is make and receive calls. It is a flip phone, thin and compact. It slides into his pocket easily, holds a charge for at least a week since he doesn't use it much. The numbers are a bit bigger than most phones and he doesn't complain about the hearing problem with his hearing aids. For what he wanted, you couldn't ask for better. 1;	0.1	2.9

B00FJ8YCZM	4	Beautiful phone Pros: lightweight, beautiful screen, fast, powerful Cons: Somewhat awkward to hold, confusing software, expensive Awesome phone with plenty of potential. Great if you are willing to put in some time to optimize it. Software suffers from having 3 masters: Samsung, Google and wireless carrier(in my case Sprint). Everyone wants you to use their store and apps. My advice is to use Google (it is an android phone after all) and add the other bits as you need them. If you're really ambitious troll YouTube for Note 3 tips and techniques. If you prefer phone use with one hand there are special setting to shrink and move the buttons to facilitate that. But I'd recommend a Galaxy S4 or iPhone instead. Update 06/06/2014 Still love the hardware. The software or rather the battle with the software providers is getting on my nerves. For example, picture handling is totally out of control. Google started automatically downloading my pictures to my google+ account. Samsung would like to but I don't have a Samsung specific account. Dropbox has to be stopped from automatically doing this. What I really want is to download pictures to my computer where I can edit them. Simple huh? Well not in this new world. Android phones and Mac computers don't like each other. If you want to do what THEY want you to do, life is a trip down a water slide. If you want to do something else its a climb UP a water slide. Also: car chargers are an issue for this phone. See my review for the PowerGen 4.2Amps / 20W Dual USB Car charger Designed for Apple and Android Devices If you DON'T keep your phone in a pocket or on your belt this is a great, inexpensive case:i-Blason Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Note III N9000 Smart Phone Leather Slim Book Case Cover with Stand Feature (Black) 1;	0.1	6.5

B00HWEJJSQ	4	Great but some problems... I was an iPhone defector, and this has been my first experience with an Android device. So far, the Samsung S4 exceeds all expectations, and works great. If you're wanting a strong fast mobile device that has all the features you've been missing like a MicroSD slot, and much more, this is the device for you. The only negative I've had is that sometimes the Android OS will randomly consume high amounts of battery. I've found after a reboot, it'll be fine for a while. I'm not sure if it's a Samsung problem or an Android problem. It's not a big issue, but it has left me with a dead phone. 1;	0.2	3.3

B00HWEJJSQ	4	The right size. This phone is very nice and my wife loves it. The colors on the display are vibrant (although not realistic) and it has the familiar Samsung TouchWiz interface.

B00HWEJJSQ	4	better than an iphone I like the phone but have had some weird things happen with it, where it is fully charged but will randomly shut down and not turn back on unless I take the battery out of it.

B00HWEJJSQ	4	Awesome phone with a storage problem This phone is awesome! It's fast, the Samsung overlays don't get in the way of Android's solid base functionality, and the form factor is perfect. It could be a five-star phone, with one big exception: The OS files reside on the internal storage, not on their own separate storage. This means the 16 GB (a little over 14 GB formatted) of internal storage has almost 7 GB taken up by OS files. That means you're left with not quite 8 GB for any apps you install. If I had been able to I would have gone with the 32 GB version. The other irritation is the storage only being accessible by MTP or PTP, not mass storage. As I understand this is an Android architecture issue and not limited to this phone, but it's still annoying. 1;	0.0	3.5

I admit I'm 67 yrs old, but I still think the whole concept is difficult to use. Why in the Heck don't they provide FREE, complete directions with their products??? What's up with that? What a deplorable concept. Does Samsung think all people are equal when it comes to using a device like this? NOT!

Feels great, size is a big step up from my old iPhone but not to the point that it would be unweildy. Chassis is just very in tune with me. Very fast, lightning quick, haven't found an app yet that lags on it. Everything happens as you tap it. A pleasure to tap and swipe away. Very responsive. Bad things are here too, though. Call quality seems inconsistent. Even on its best day it's not as clear as my iPhone was. Have tested in many areas of the city, suburbs, urban, rural, indoor, outdoor, all kinds of weather, night and day, the calls are just not clear. Significant problem if you use your phone as, you know, a phone. Battery life is pretty god-awful. I baby my battery, I mean REALLY really baby it, I keep it on airplane mode with location services turned off, for more than half the day while I'm at work and the battery still manages to die in less than two days. Not to mention, Cortana does not work when location services are disabled, just worth noting, so if you want to use Cortana, be prepared to charge your phone twice a day depending where you live. Also, since the battery is on the large side (2.5A) and the phone is eating power while you charge, charging takes longer than any other phone I've used. This is my biggest gripe. Not sure where the power is going when I'm in airplane mode with the phone in standby. Of course, the app store is abysmal, no one makes apps for these things. Not the phone's fault but you should be aware when shopping for a WinPhone. I am a developer and hope to be a part of changing that but for the time being, don't expect to find a lot of apps for these phones - even the incomplete and buggy Facebook app was implemented by Microsoft because Facebook themselves didn't think it was worth their time to provide an app for WinPhone. Final gripe, communications bugs... WiFi cuts out at random, will drop / forget routers and not find them until you REBOOT the phone completely. The phone seems to have trouble syncing email, at least with Google / gMail. Doesn't sync everytime, and sometimes when it does sync it takes a few minutes. Text messages come in doubled or tripled sometimes for no apparent reason. And on top of that, the phone quality, as mentioned about, kinda sucks. Overall I do like the phone. Design-wise it's nice and I love it more than any phone I've had. Pleasure to use. Despite my gripes, I would rather have a Nokia WinPhone than an iPhone or Android. Just my opinion. I would buy it again. And I recommend anyone to try it at least. But just to be fair, Nokia WinPhone do have some catching up to do with Apple, Samsung, etc. 1;	0.0	19.5

B00HWENIUG	4	I love it. I have been using the Nokia Lumia ... So far, I love it. I have been using the Nokia Lumia 928 for some time, and the screen broke. Having these things fixed costs upwards of $200, so I figured I would just shell out for a new phone at that point. Found this factory refurbished Icon for $260, and it's quite the steal, I might add! The 20 megapixel camera is great. A little slow, but great. I was use to the slowness anyways as the 928 is the same. Takes a sec to focus. I like the look of it. Very sleek and attractive. My only complaint is that the lock button takes a little longer to activate the phone from sleep mode. The 928 was instant, but that's not a big deal. Love my new phone! 1;	0.3	9.2

Even though this is an SPH-L720 and I had another SPH-L720 on freedompop already -- there are ESN based restrictions placed by the carrier. Sprint only releases a certain range of ESN numbers to freedompop. The SPH-L720 that I happened to receive was restricted to JUST Sprint, and I could not use freedompop with it. Ended up switching to Sprint anyway, so I am keeping the phone. Sprint happeend to have a good deal on unlimited talk/text/data. So it worked out. 1;	0.0	2.9

There are some things that seem glitchy, but also could simply be me learning to use the device. Upgraded the SD micro card to a 32 GB for a whopping $24. I really like that option and it is a significant reason why I went with the S5 Active vs. the S6. Too bad Samsung is no longer offering that option going forward. Because of it, this will probably be my last Galaxy. :>( 1;	0.3	5.9

B00N532DU4	4	Excellent Condition ! So I brought this phone I have had it least then 3 months now . It's freezing up . I'm rating it 4 stars because it's obviously used but other than that it was in Excellent condition no dents or scratches. It has great battery power it stays charge for at least 10 hrs it all depends on rather u playing games or spend an enormous amount of time on the internet. Over its a fair Good buy.! 1;	0.4	4.2

Since using the phone it has gotten stuck several times... meaning the touch screen was inoperative for a minute or sometimes I wouldn't be able to turn the phone on if it was in the off position.

Had it for two years and was never disappointed in any of its various up and downsides. I'd still have it but came to realize that the technology curve moves on, products either get better or replaced so on that soberting note (no pun), I upgraded to the Note 4. I'm in the early stages of learning the Note 4 so this won't be a tour de force review of what it is, can do or be. The love of the Note 2 is why I chose to go with the Note 4. So far, that trust seems worth it. 1;	0.4	3.6

This time, *I* ordered this one, and love the ACTIVE version, good in case of drops or accidents, I feel more secure in the durability.

I would suggest purchasing an adaptar set for your phone if you have anything bigger than the micro.

Phone was physically flawless (bought the used, like-new version), which was a little more expensive $354.00.

The only issue I have is that the data toggle doesn't show up in the drag-down menu, so I had to download that from the app store.

After all the update I did it's starting to look a little like an iPhone on how the apps look, but it's running better since I did them. No complaints except it's really hard to find a cute case.

B00YD54J8W	4	NICE PHONE!! Got this phone yesterday..looks brand new and beautiful, no scratches..comes w white charger. So far so good, I transferred all data from a Samsung Galaxy S and it was pretty easy..I also got Straight Talk from Walmart which costs an additional $65.00 ($45.00 data plan plus $15 for sim.also easy to install)..wish it came w/ paper user manual as I love to sit and read them, rather than on a computer screen, but not a deal breaker. Size is perfect for me, love that it's little bigger than my Samsung..weight is good as well. I opted for this instead of 6S plus, as the weight was too heavy for me, this one is perfect. Shipping came faster than expected and got it on a Sunday..nicely boxed. Works fine so far so..fingerprint scan is really cool..especially when downloading apps.. would recommend! 1;	0.7	5.9

B010V43VFA	4	Would like input I found the phone to meet my daily uses and enjoyed the ease of a well thought design. However, heating was a small concern and the phone seems to freeze on YouTube vids while sound continues. Services are lte in area's while spoty even in well towered locations were smaller devices received lte. Which is a first for me and not sure if it could be a fluke. In ending this I can't help but realize I was only ok with this product and blame all 3 parties (me/Sony/t mobile) for a bland review. Sony work on heat dispersion t mobile fix tower issues(choosing 3 g tower over 4 g cause it's close, bad android)me keep research active to better my experience in the future. 1;	0.0	2.3

Not unbearable but I do have concerns about the longevity of the product given how hot it gets every once in a while. The phone experience overall has been amazing, camera very solid, performance good, battery will get me through an entire day without using stamina mode, and my Good app is constantly syncing so that is impressive. Sounds quality for music is good, call quality not as strong. I would say my previous phone, Motorola Moto X 2013, had better call reception. Design, look, and feel on this phone though is top notch.

Which it has broken the arm in the module for the pen to sense the pen is connected. Just so the person now's and is selling these devices you can fix these with little as 10 to 15 bucks and it's not hard fix. But overall I think I know the reason why it's set at that price because he knew if he fixed them the price would 10 bucks less to original because he had open them fix 'em.

B015FZLA8A	4	The aspect that I enjoy the most is not having the tons of Samsung ... This phone is such a significant upgrade over my Galaxy S4 that I was surprised that it was the price it was >300. I paid 600 for my S4 a year or two ago through my carrier. The aspect that I enjoy the most is not having the tons of Samsung apps that do not add anything to my day to day life. This phone came stock with Google Chrome and not much else besides the necessities such as a camera and other basics. Not having SD card support brings the phone down one star, but for most people (i.e. those that don't download a bunch of movies to their phones) the 64 GB of internal storage should be plenty of storage space. One other thing that bothers me is that the battery life isn't the best, but when you consider the performance that you are getting it is understandable.

I got the Samsung fast adaptive charger and it is great but only stays charging in portrait mode. I don't know if this a defect in the charger, the phone or the fact that the Otter Box case keeping phone too far away.

B01CYYYRNK	4	Be Careful - Substitute Models being Shipped While I like the S7 Phone, you have to be careful when purchasing from Amazon and it's third parties. These phone may not (and probably are not) AT&T models. They are 930F, 930U or 930D unlocked phones which will not support all AT&T functionality and may not have full reception on AT&T networks.

The battery is may not super long lasting but as it was preowned, it is probably normal lifetime.

B01DZJFWWS	4	"Pretty Good phone for the Price \There have been plenty of questions asking if this unlocked phone can be activated on the Verizon Wireless (VzW) network. The answer is yes, but it didn't happen very smoothly for me. I was not able to take the active micro SIM from my Galaxy S5 and activate the Moto G, which should have worked. After several tries, referencing feedback on Moto G blogs, calls and visits to VzW stores, it was suspected that I had a bad SIM slot, but not before at least 2 VzW Reps questioned if it's even compatible on their network. I returned the phone to Amazon, received a replacement and took the new, unboxed phone straight to VzW. (Corp store where they provide free SIM cards.) My thought was to give it one more try. If it really wasn't compatible with their network, so be it. The VzW Rep opened the box, inserted a new micro SIM card; it activated right away. Solid connectivity to their LTE network. The phone has been great up to this point. I read several reviews before making the purchase. I was using the Galaxy S5 for a couple of years on VzW under contract and, while I really didn't have many issues with that phone, decided to try something different since I was eligible for an upgrade. I wasn't in the market to spend a whole lot of money; a couple of hundred dollars (or less) is about my speed for a smartphone. Reviews (like \""\""CNET best phones of 2016\""\"") pointed to the Moto G being a good  less pricey model to go with. This is a personal phone;"""	0.0	6.1

B01FJT7E0A	4	AMAZING phone, TERRIBLE battery. Buy charging case!! I absolutely love this phone. I'm definitely an Xperia fan now. Screw Samsung, and screw Apple. This phone is awesome!!! There is so much you can do and so many customization options, it reminds me of when I use to use jailbroken iPhones. For anyone who's never had an Xperia, I highly recommend them after buying this phone. Although I gave it 4 stars because the battery is an absolute piece of crap. I mean it is pure trash. The phone itself is absolutely amazing, but not the battery. I have to keep my screen brightness all the way down and turned off a bunch of pointless settings to make the battery last all day, I think I'm just going to buy a charging case because this battery SUCKS. But I'm a big Xperia fan now, and once I start making better money I'm going to buy a new Xperia. I'm going to add a screenshot just to show what my Xperia looks like after customizing it UPDATE So, I refuse to buy any other cell phone now. From now on, I will go with an Xperia. So I woke up yesterday and morning and drove to the store to get something to drink, came home, and realized I lost my phone. So I looked and looked but couldn't find it because the ground was covered in snow and my Xperia is white. So I drove back to the store to see if I dropped it, couldn't find it. Then the temperature rose and the snow started melting. I walked back up near my truck and found my phone, shattered with a skid mark on the back laying in a fresh tire track. Turns out in the process of trying to find my phone I back over with with a 2003 Ford f150, and the phone was soaked because the snow was melting. I brought it inside, wiped it off best I could, then let it sit in rice for the rest of the day and night, and the next day while I was at work. When I got home, I pulled it out of the rice, charged it up no problem, and now I'm writing this review on it. The phone still works after being ran over with a truck WITHOUT A CASE!!! Now I'm not gonna say it works great because it doesn't. The speaker doesn't work anymore, and whenever I try to call someone on Facebook the screen goes black and I have to keep messaging with the power button to get it to come back on so I just won't call anyone until he get a new phone. But I'm telling you right now this is THE TOUGHEST phone I have ever had and I refuse to get anything other than Xperia from now on. 1;	0.0	12.5

B01FJT7E0A	4	The look of the phone is amazing and it feels light The look of the phone is amazing and it feels light. Watching videos on the phone is also a huge part in the enjoyment. The graphics looks amazing on this phone . The con is the front camera it's horrible, it's blurry even when it's focused. The back camera is you're only chance to take a picture. However it still isn't very clear. The phone can break pretty easy , I broke mines on day 2. I was lucky enough to get a return and use that money to buy an iPhone 5s . I don’t like having a phone that I have to be extremely careful with... it’s like watching a toddler. In short, the phone is beautiful and it’s pretty easy to use and light on the hands. However, you will need to buy a heavy case for protection and/or buy a protection plan for the phone . The screen will break instantly with a drop. 1;	0.1	6.5

B01FJT7E3M	4	Excelente movil, sólo tiene un fallo En Octubre de 2016 compré este teléfono, es bastante bueno, sobre todo la calidad de las fotografías, de hecho compré este teléfono porque era uno de los mejores de mercado en cuanto a la calidad de la cámara. El único fallo es que el botón de inicio se quedó sin funcionar hace unos seis meses e inicio el teléfono con el botón emergente para activar la cámara. Sé que el nuevo modelo tiene un segundo botón de inicio en la parte posterior del móvil, imagino que esta mejora es porque vieron el fallo en este modelo. Sin duda me compraría otro Sony Xperia, soy fotógrafa y si tengo que hacer una fotografía y no tengo conmigo mi reflex sé que podré hacer una fotografia de buena calidad con mi móvil. Tuve un accidente con el teléfono, por una emergencia en la cocina coloqué una olla hirviendo encima del teléfono, lo tengo con un protector y sorpresivamente no lo ocurrió nada, creo que tuvo que ver muchísimo el protector que tiene, la combinación perfecta. 1;	0.3	2.1
B01FJT7E3M	4	Charging port I bought this phone back in April and I love it. The camera is amazing, and the phone functions very well. The only thing that is bothering me is that when I bought it the charging port was already loose. I wish it wasn't like that because I'm scared that it won't charge. But not her than that, it's a beautiful phone. My mom will be purchasing one in September because she loves mine. Update. I'm really scared that the phone will stop charging because the charging port is loose. I'm trying to contact the buyer but I don't have luck.

B01FJT7E3M	4	Phone for my mom...She likes it Bought this phone for my mom and she likes it a lot! The only thing I have an issue with is the camera is kind of weak. It's not awful, and its better than her iPhone 5c, but it doesn't compare to my Honor 8. Also, the sound isn't as full as she's used to (she had an Axon 7 Mini until it stopped working with the nougat update). Otherwise, its a beautiful phone. The screen is huge! I didn't think it would be that big and I was worried but she said it fits nicely in her hand. She does miss iMesssage sometimes, but I think she's a fan of the new system. 1;	0.2	4.4

B01FJT7E3M	4	Beautiful phone Hello sony fans, I ordered this sony xperia xa ultra and let me tell you that this is an amazing, the only problem that I had with this phone is that it was too large to use as my everyday driver. I was upgrading from my galaxy note 3 because it was time, I would have been ok with the ultra if it wasn't too wide, so instead I ordered the xperia xa ultra N loving it...I guess this phone deserves 5 stars instead of 4 but that's my opinion...good luck yaa. 1;	0.7	1.5

B01FJT7E3M	4	Works well, does phone things. If you like big screens and great selfies, buy it. This is a very good phone overall - my biggest complains with it are the limitations imposed by the small internal memory (since the OS and apps reside there, you have to pick and choose your apps! Absurd!) and the Sony camera placement - My fingers go over the phone edge, please pull it in just a little further. The front camera has a 16MP camera with stabilization - insane for a phone. Oddly, the rear camera does not, at 21MP. 1;	0.2	3.9
B01FJT7E3M	4	Excellent Phone for the Price, your getting what you Pay for This is a very good Phone if you can live with 16 GB and a Battery what will not make it through the Day. I don't know what Sony was thinking when they brought this Phone out. I still like it better than these Apple IFLOP Phones i retired my IFLOP Phones that 6 & 7 Sucks. This Sony Phone has one of the best Camera's out there one any Phone unless you get the other Sony Phone what will cost you 2 to 3 Hundred $$$ more. This is a great Phone for the Price you getting what you pay fore and more but for me i think i will wait now for a newer Sony Phone and will Play with this Phone for awhile it is still better than a Apple Phone. This is a very good Phone for the Price no more and no less very Good Sony but we need a much better Battery, but not like Samsung or Apple where your phone melts down LOL. 1;	0.4	4.1

B01FJT7N4W	4	Good phone; keep fingers crossed for an enabled fingerprint scanner. It arrive in pristine condition and somehow has the fingerprint scanner enabled; I thought this feature was disabled in the US? Anyway, if you're buying this in 2018 prepare to spend the first couple hours or so installing 2 years worth of Android updates (which is both good and bad). This is my first non-Nexus device in 5 years so the pre-installed, irremovable apps are a bit of an annoyance, but thankfully the bloat is minimal and you have most of your phone's resources at your disposal. All in all, I enjoyed using this phone in the few hours I've had it -- it's responsive, smooth and the build is pretty nice. This will serve as a fine replacement for my Nexus 5. 1;	0.4	2.9
B01FJT7N4W	4	... phone for 5 months now and I have been pretty impressed. If you want a more reliable phone Had the phone for 5 months now and I have been pretty impressed. If you want a more reliable phone, save up for the more pricy phones that Sony does, but this phone is pretty good for the price. The screen has become pretty scratched, but I have not used a screen protector as the market for cases and screen protectors for this phone are very slim and low quality. Camera is very good, but my only stipulation is that it overheats and shuts off after about 5 to 7 minutes of recording. 1;	0.2	4.2

So far, the only issue I've had with this in the first week of use has been overheating whilst charging and using camera at the same time. 😬 I hope it's not a preview of future performance, as the z1 only started acting up after it had been accidently dropped on numerous occasions. Headphones, interestingly, we're not included. Love the ease of the interface, and excellent camera quality. Miss the glass backing. 1;	0.2	2.7

I got it to replace an older iPhone 4 that I was using for the same purpose. The Bluetooth is great and the battery life is exceptional which were the important functions. I did load a few apps on it and am somewhat disappointed in the limited on board memory because of all the bloatware.

B01H3V07EW	4	Amazing hardware and UI, hampered by issues with AT&T This phone brings with it the quality you would expect with a smartphone like the S7 or iPhone 7, but much cheaper. Unfortunately, OnePlus is not the best with AT&T. I'm not sure what the situation is with other providers, but AT&T simply does not provide full support for any of the phones in the OnePlus line. This means not getting LTE for many people (including myself), no HD calling, and issues with switching between WiFi and data. I still am completely unable to connect to LTE, and am always on H+. If you're willing to work through all that, the phone is really special. I got the 3, but I'm sure the 3T is even faster. The UI is simple, never lags, and is almost completely devoid of bloatware. The biggest difference I see coming from Apple is more freedom to do what you want on the phone. I've also owned an S7 Active, and I can say that Oxygen OS is much faster. 1;	0.0	5.6

B01L1BOQT2	4	One small hitch I only have one negative thing to report: the phone was not completely refurbished/wiped because as soon as I activated it and downloaded Spotify (and logged into my own account), I found myself at war with another person/entity who managed to commandeer my account from a desktop somewhere. It turns out that whoever owned this phone before me still has their account linked to the phone (through no fault of their own) and every week or so they try to play their own music on a desktop browser which shuts off my music and we end up in a battle (which I usually win) for the next twenty minutes. So...be warned. 1;	0.0	1.2

B01LACBLEK	4	Slightly wide form factor and NO FINGERPRINT scanner; SE is better compact phone Great compact Android (so hard to find with only a few Sony models), but not much cheaper than an iPhone SE (at lower storage). “Died” after one year of usage- turned off at night, wouldn’t turn on again.. vs iPhone SE + Expandable memory + Slightly cheaper (a good bit cheaper at 128GB if using memory expansion, SE does not have memory slot) = Battery life = Different OS - Form factor (SE is narrower) - Case material (SE is metal) - No finger scanner (Sony does not include thumb scanner on US compact models - touch ID is super useful, I would not go back to no finger scanner!) 1;	0.2	0.7
B01LACBLEK	4	Good Compact Phone A very good looking phone that is capable of being fully submerged in water and still able to operate, though this is done at your own risk since it is not certified water resistant. The camera is very good in well lit day shots. A very wide aperture allows you to capture a lot in one shot. Selfie camera is good as well. This phone has a finger print scanner but on any model from the US it will be disabled. If you want a working finger print scanner, you would have to buy a European model or Root your US model. Good performance for games. Very fluid and smooth animations in operating the UI. No overheating issues. One issue I have with this phone is the durability of the phones body. I have not dropped the phone so I'm not speaking on hard impacts, but rather the durability of the screen and the plastic back. I am very careful with this phone and I collected quite a few small scratches on the back and the front. I am disappointed in the front glass durability, while the back is expected since it is plastic. When you buy this device order a case/skin and a screen protector along with it right away. Overall a great phone that is a compact higher end mid range. 1;	0.3	8.3

B01LACBLEK	4	Waterproof! I bought this phone a little more than a year ago so I've put it through some pretty severe life tests. This is the best phone I've ever owned. That's partly because I like small handsets and partly because it's been very rugged. Pros: * Waterproof. I am an avid surf fisherman and I take this phone with me with no protection. I have a pouch on my surf belt that I keep it in. Like all my other fishing bags, it's made to drain well, not keep anything waterproof. This phone has been sprayed with salt water, dunked in salt water and rained on for hours with absolutely no sign of degradation. I don't purposely dunk it, but I don't do anything special to protect it either. This is the phone's #1 virtue to me. The touch input does not work when the screen is wet (like every other phone). That's the only drawback. * Sony pushes updates regularly. Yesterday I got Android 8 update. Very nice. Most manufacturers end updates after a year or so. * The camera is nice and I really like having a dedicated camera button that will wake up the phone to take a picture. It could be a little faster when waking up and launching the camera, but it's still a nice feature. * There UI is clean with very little bloatware. Cons: * No official Lineage OS. That's a bummer for me but probably 99% of people buying the phone don't care. Sony is pretty open with developers, but I guess there is still a few things locked down. I stopped paying attention when I found that Lineage could not be ported easily. * There is no decent screen protector available due to the rounded edges. I tried a few and finally gave up and I just go without. There are plenty of cases available and I use a silicone one and haven't had any issues with the screen getting scratched or cracked. It's been dropped many times (fingers crossed the next time won't be the one that breaks the glass). But so far so good. So overall, a great phone with a couple of minor drawbacks. There aren't many choices for phones in this company category to begin with. 1;	0.1	14.7
B01LACBLEK	4	Botched oreo update mars a good phone I enjoyed the Xperia Compact X. I really did. A well made phone that was small enough to easily fit in your pocket, but still well powered and very snappy, performance-wise. On Nougat, the phone is great. Sony, to its credit, released a software update to upgrade the phone to Oreo, effectively extending the lifespan of the device. They brought the Oreo update to their phone faster than other manufacturers, but this update has come at a cost: the update is half-baked and has some glitches and performance decreases that effect the overall quality of the phone. Three major issues I've noticed so far: 1. Connecting Bluetooth devices can crash the phone. Worked smoothly without issue in Nougat. 2. Adaptive brightness is glitchy (the display brightness is slow to change with the surroundings, if it changes at all. It worked great in Nougat). 3. Sony removed the Magnifying glass cursor feature in Oreo (which is really helpful on a smaller screen). It's unlikely that Sony will provide any new updates to fix the Oreo issues on the X Compact, so I would recommend staying on Nougat if you can. 1;	0.2	7.5
B01LACBLEK	4	great phone but not reaching its full potential Pros: - one hand phone and potable - balanced hardware specification. For 720P small screen, I don't need a flagship chip for a whooping price. - a relatively clean Android system. - I receive frequent updates - Long long battery duration - Nice audio quality in a small form factor. Cons: - Not paying US carrier for certificate. So no VoLTE, no Wifi calling.(tested in ATT and T-mobile) - awkward volume button - Pricey before. Hope less than 350 when it first came out.... - Need to flash ROM to get fingerprint sensor (I tried Singapore version. Pretty much same as US version. UK don't say LTE, but 4G) Some solutions for things people are not happy about. - Some are not happy that Spotify is in the ROM. Solution: I used App Cloner to clone the older version of Spotify. - Screen too small for a full keyboard. Solution: I install T9 English keyboard. (Google Chinese Pingyin Input include T9.) Overall, it is a great phone but not showing its full potential. 1;	0.0	5.2
B01LACBLEK	4	It has plus and minus attributes Like everything in life, nothing is perfect, neither is this phone. It does come close though. Pluses- small form factor for one handed use, bright display, very acceptable volume and sound when playing music, amazingly quick and accurate fingerprint scanner. ( I ordered a unit with a US warranty and this had the fingerprint scanner activated. After checking with Sony, this does have a US warranty but I am guessing the phone originated from Mexico. Some of the original screens were in Spanish which I had to change to English. A few of the screens cannot be changed but I don't find them disturbing) Cons - Very low in some cases almost inaudible speakerphone for calls and navigation - a huge draw back for me, very limited cases and screen protectors that are all of poor quality, quirky activation of Google Assistant with the use of headphones inserted -sometimes Assistant works other times Google Assistant cannot be found, camera picture quality is not what I expected - in comparison to my Moto e there really isn't much difference, lastly is the chunky sharp angles that make carrying it in a pocket very noticeable and slightly unsightly. Everything considered, there are not many compacts available so Sony really doesn't have to knock anyone off the block. Take it or leave it. It really would be a plus to Sony if they put the phone into a Moto g 1st gen case. Those 2g phones still sell for over $200 because of their form factor which is the same size a this compact. 1;	0.0	2.8
B01LACBLEK	4	Almost perfect Display looks great for only 720p. Not AMOLED. Can get very bright but not to uncomfortable levels. Stereo front facing speakers that aren't too loud but reach a decent volume. Front facing camera works, nothing special. Love the form and size of this phone. Metal and/or glass would be nice though. Fingerprint scanner doesn't work on US version, it can be flashed with an english firmware in a region where it is enabled but updating would be difficult. Waterproof. The vibration on this phone is the absolute strongest I've ever felt in a handheld device. Usb C. Has a headphone jack, the output is quiet. Dedicated camera button. A lot of software features: It can be connected to a ps4 controller easily, can remote play a ps4, glove mode, different themes that can change the look of the on-screen buttons. Expandable storage. I ended up selling it for a google pixel. I need a louder 3.5 jack output and louder speakers. Miss the notification light and vibration. 1;	0.3	7.1
B01LACBLEK	4	One of the few powerful phones in small size I was a big fan of the Xperia Z3 Compact that I had prior to the Xperia X Compact. There are very few phones of this size available that have good specs. I'm a little disappointed that the Xperia X Compact does not have any waterproof rating, and that Sony has moved from the top of the line processor, but I've found the phone to be plenty zippy. The size is very similar to the Z3C. Some people might claim that the plastic case is not as nice as the Z series glass cases, but having broken the back of my Z3C twice, partially because it slipped out of my hands so easily, I can say that I'm quite happy to have moved away from the slippery glass. The camera takes nice pictures. It has twice as much storage as the Z3C, which was often running out of space. I find it to look nice and work well. My main gripe with the phone is that the lock screen seems to get stuck from time to time. It's easy to work around by hitting the shutter button, but I shouldn't have to work around anything on a new phone. 1;	0.2	3.9
B01LACBLEK	4	Good size for a guy who carries his phone in his pocket. I bought this phone because it was the only smart phone I could find that would fit in my pocket since everyone else has gone for the simi-tablet phones. Works pretty well but is loaded with garbage apps that I can't get rid of and it has a habit of becoming non-responsive just when I need it most like trying to answer an important call and having to not answer or go to some other function for no reason. 1;	0.0	1.6
B01LACBLEK	4	Sony Xperia X Compact Good phone, very impressive camera, good battery life, quick responses to any inputs,front stereo loudspeakers are just ok, but not even close to iphone or other high enders in performance.

B01LACBLEK	4	Great phone so far Great phone so far. I appreciate the small form factor. As others have said, the volume rocker is placed a bit awkwardly, but it's great for a left-handed person. The camera and processor perform well, as do the speakers. The phone does charge a bit slowly for using USB-C. Sony's Android skin is unobtrusive, not as pared down as Motorola, but better than most other major OEMs. Sony's stock keyboard is crap, so ditch that. I wish it had the fingerprint sensor enabled. 1;	0.2	3.8
B01LEL8ABY	4	Great phone battery eh. This phone is over all very good. It is fast and the screen looks great. As far as buget it checks all the boxes. Less then 350. Still receiving updates. AMOLED screen. Great build quality. Snapdradon 800s processer. It really is great. The battery is the only negtive if you don't mind keeping it on battery saver mode you can get through a full day with no problems but with out the battery saver mode you will be hard pressed to get through a full day. But the fast charger makes this problem easier to stomach but it does not fix it. Over all I love this phone and probably in a year I will have to buy the battery pack to use this phone but for the money I would recommend it if you want a 5.5 inch screen. 1;	0.4	7.7

B01M7O431L	4	Good, but with imperfections So, I always buy phones outright and normally a model or two behind. To me that makes the most sense financially. When I chose the S7 edge it was replacing my S6 edge that has developed a less responsive screen and a thin purple line running down my phone. When this one came it looked to be in great condition, no scratches or dents. I turned it on and since it was refurbished I was expecting some imperfections, and the only significant one I've noticed was that the icons in the bottom of the screen (phone, text, internet, apps) were burned into the screen as if someone left the brightness on the highest setting and just let the phone sit on the home screen for a day. I could/can see them no matter what I had displayed on my phone. I could overlook it, so I did. But less than a year after purchase I am experiencing the same thin purple line running along the length of the screen which is really disheartening. I do keep my phone in a protective case and have very minimal dropping of it, so I'm not sure what the cause of it is. So, it's a good purchase for me, because I prefer not to pay $800+ for a cellphone, but the defects are something to take note of if you are ordering refurbished goods. 1;	0.0	3.4

B01N1SCZ86	4	Good android phone, Samsung is consistent Ordered June 26, 2017. Died July 9, 2018. This is the longest I've ever had a phone, and considering that I took it to the welding shop with me on the daily, it has survived a lot: grinding dust, huge amounts of electrical interference, metal chips, slag, etc.... Solid android software, I used a cleaner app to keep the ram clear and remove the extra files (read: garbage) because the phone liked to overheat at times of heavy use. This phone works best if you don't have too many apps; I never ran out of storage but the ram gets full pretty quickly and can keep the phone hot. Battery worked great (worked all day from 8 am to 10 pm) until the last week of it's life when I was charging it 3x a day, then finally it would charge no more. The only downsides to this phone are: bad speaker quality during phone calls (almost always needed to put the calls on speaker because I couldn't hear the person on the other side). And a sealed in battery (which isn't my ideal anyway, but this is the way that smart phones are trending so I'll have to get used to it) with a glass back (pretty but prone to breakage, easily dirtied, easy to drop). TIPS: get a nice (heavy duty) case, a tempered glass screen protector, use a cleaner app to keep it running as ideally as possible and don't overload it with apps. 1;	0.4	4.9
B01N1SCZ86	4	Refurbished? Could have fooled me.... BUT no SIM tray pin Phone looks brand spanking new! The only reason why I am leaving 4 stars, is because it did not come with a pin for the SIM tray. Now i need to find something small enough to work. Other than that, very, very happy. 1;	0.1	1.8

B01N2HPFWK	4	Google Pixel Xl “open-box” Update The Google Pixel XL was purchased “open box” condition and looked spotless. Works well. However, charger (Flextronics brand) or charger cable that came with it stopped functioning after 4 uses and less than a week. Hoping seller will replace. The speaker volume could be louder and the sound quality of music played or in apps is a little thin. I purchased a Samsung 8 recently and feel the 8’s audio is better, it’s a little faster and gets better WiFi reception than this Pixel Xl. Still, great deal for a 4gb Ram, 128gb storage smartphone. Also, like Google’s native voice assistant as opposed to Samsung’s clunky Bixby. Even though this model is 3 yrs, it’s still a good buy in 2019 for prices found on Amazon. Update - seller suggests return the phone but did not suggest replacing the charger. The phone will fast charge with OEM Samsung Galaxy S8 but Google Pixel type (can’t seem to find a seller who provides genuine OEM Google charger and card) will not work. Sadly will have to return because it could be a problem with the port. Also, noticed that the video play back YouTube, gifs, or embedded webpage videos has some issues after 20 or 30 minutes use, has long pauses. 1;	0.0	5.9
B01N2HPFWK	4	A good phone Not a bad phone for it 'age', it updated to Android 9 without problems, good reception on CDMA, battery last ~ 2 days with below avg., use which is a bit disappointing. Screen is good, fingerprint reader is fast, camera is also very good. 1;	0.5	1.5
B01N4E0RF1	4	Smart Lock is glitchy I like the battery life, memory, and the improved functionality. Some things are glitchy, though. The Do Not Disturb feature notifies me with a beep when it turns off. Annoying since I have to check to see if I actually got a text or email. Also, the Smart Lock feature doesn't work reliably. Sometimes yes, sometimes no, in the same locations. Also, since the Smart Lock automatically locks the screen after 4 hours, you would think that after I enter the correct PIN it would stay unlocked when I am at a trusted location, i.e. home. Small inconvenience for a pretty good phone overall. 1;	0.0	5.3
B01N4E0RF1	4	Excellent, with minor flaws. Phone was in like new shape, no scratches, dings or dents. Only thing I find wrong is that the battery life is underwhelming, will barely make it the day with light-moderate usage, other than that it's great for half the price of the carrier. 1;	0.5	2.0

B01N4E0RF1	4	I like it....... Pretty much a brand new looking S7 arrived. Quality, speed, performance all great so far. Only reason 4 stars instead of 5 (refurbished standards of course) is for the battery life and minimal screen burn in. The quality, speed, and performance eat into the battery quick, but if just sitting in sleep its ok enough. The screen has zero scratches and great picture, but there is a little screen burn in. Slight ghosting of the notification bar. Not noticeable at all with certain darker colors, but lighter colors u can see it. However i did my homework before purchasing a refurbished phone and a lot of people commented on getting screen burn in with their new phones less than a year after purchasing. So having said that it was only $140 and it's light years ahead of my Motorola Droid Maxx. Lol... So as of now I'm more than satisfied with this purchase. I recommend not using the quick charge feature. Just not a fan of quickly charging a battery and getting it hot in the process. SMH... Plus half brightness for the screen is a common recommendation and plenty bright enough. Pictures... Pulled 300mbps on 5 band wifi from modem, captured a frame from video of a lightning strike, and last is a screenshot of my home page. ByE....... 1;	0.2	8.6

B01N9XOXCK	4	Good, but with imperfections So, I always buy phones outright and normally a model or two behind. To me that makes the most sense financially. When I chose the S7 edge it was replacing my S6 edge that has developed a less responsive screen and a thin purple line running down my phone. When this one came it looked to be in great condition, no scratches or dents. I turned it on and since it was refurbished I was expecting some imperfections, and the only significant one I've noticed was that the icons in the bottom of the screen (phone, text, internet, apps) were burned into the screen as if someone left the brightness on the highest setting and just let the phone sit on the home screen for a day. I could/can see them no matter what I had displayed on my phone. I could overlook it, so I did. But less than a year after purchase I am experiencing the same thin purple line running along the length of the screen which is really disheartening. I do keep my phone in a protective case and have very minimal dropping of it, so I'm not sure what the cause of it is. So, it's a good purchase for me, because I prefer not to pay $800+ for a cellphone, but the defects are something to take note of if you are ordering refurbished goods. 1;	0.0	3.4

I know that s7 active AT&T box is not a good one but I did see one before. The box is nothing like that and it's like a cigarette box with not a single logo, detail or anything except a label which you can stick on anything and the IMEI is written on it. The other problem which I'm not sure about that is that there is no OTG in the box. I know that I shouldn't expect a headphone too but I was hoping at least there is a OTG in the box! Beside the seller problems, I don't like a thing about my phone. THERE IS NO MOBILE DATA TOGGLE!!!!!!!!! It's so annoying at first to don't see this toggle in the quick setting. seriously AT&T, what's wrong with you? Regard all these complainings, I should say that I LOVE this phone. The battery is GREAT, the phone is firm and I should admit it's the best phone that I've ever had! 1;	0.0	6.7
B01N9YOVME	4	And yet she persisted The fingerprint feature does not work. The side locking button wakes the screen up without asking for the pin I set up though it does ask for my pin when I wake it up with the home button. The battery charges 10% every 1.5 hours with the included charging cable and adapter. The receiver and physical buttons on the front were filled with an amazing amount of accumulated gunk. The original at&t bloatware survived. In spite of all this I cleaned it up and I like it. I'll get a better charger and at the phone is holding charge just fine.

B01NB1IGR8	4	Happy with my purchase :) I'm very pleased with this phone thus far! I've had it since Saturday, and I'm loving it! It runs very smoothly, and I've had very few hiccups. It was easy to transfer files and apps, and even my home screen layout from my old Samsung device to the Note 5. This device is locked to Sprint, but I'm sure we can go to a store to get it unlocked without too much hassle. Charging is faster than any device I've had. In 18-20 minutes, it charged from 43% to 75%. That's pretty awesome in my book! In addition to this, it also came with a new charger :) The one minor negative thing I will say though, is the S-pen calibration does seem to be a bit off, though I doubt that's something permanent. An easy fix, I hope! Otherwise, the S-pen works smoothly as with the rest of the phone. I'm a very happy customer! All in all, this is a great price for a great phone!

B01NH5HCGZ	4	Works very well, fast charging is convenient, a large selection of mods and add-ons This phone intrigued me, as I purchased one for a friend and was scrolling through the settings before I found the one related to mods. What are mods, you might ask? They are devices that you can attach to the back of your phone to make it do things that it wasn't originally designed for. I'm all for the modular approach, and although I haven't actually purchased any, I've heard very good things about them. As for the actual functionality of the phone, it's got some nifty features there too. Instead of having to constantly lock and unlock your device with the side button, you have an option to use the fingerprint sensor (which by the way is more consistent then the one on my Galaxy S7, and way more satisfying to use) which is convenient for a couple of reasons: One, you can lock and unlock your phone with very little physical effort or force, and two you can lock and unlock your phone with physical rumble feedback. There are also a lot of other features on the phone that I won't go into, including but not limited to a setting that allows you to turn the flashlight on and off by shaking the phone sideways. It only saves you a couple of seconds each time, but as someone who constantly uses the flashlight to see where I'm going or look for things I've dropped in dark rooms, I can tell you that the seconds add up! All in all, great product and although it's not perfect (the battery life is a little bit underwhelming, but considering the size and thinness of the phone it's understandable, and the fast-charging compensates for this somewhat) it's a satisfying and unique approach to phone design that I'm glad I discovered. 1;	0.2	5.5

B06VW5FVLB	4	Great Refurbished Smartphone The S5 is still a great phone that can give you a lot for a 5 year old flagship. The look of this refurbished is nearly brand new. Screen was like new. Battery life is strong. But I bought an extra in case. Get the OEM Samsung battery or the Anker replacement. The Verizon bloat ware likes to steal RAM and battery life. It's always been the thorn in the S5's side. Disable as much as you can. Rooting it is likely very tricky, nearly impossible... But this phone comes with Android 6.0, so it is not an ancient interface. I bought this just to use on Verizon network towers thru Straight Talk. I'm no heavy user, but this phone doesn't feel old. 1;	0.0	4.0
B06VW5FVLB	4	Worth the money; Poor battery Everything that you would expect from a good quality cellphone. Good screen resolution/quality (1080p), good speaker (for a cellphone speaker), useful functionalities (extra touch sensitivity, preview of a selection just by hovering your finger over the screen, multi windows, fingerprint lock...), BUT, and an extra but here: The battery... sucks. Don't get me wrong, the cellphone is fantastic, and for the price, it's wonderful!.. For 2 hours that is! Anyway, it charges up at a good pace, so, as long as you have somewhere to plug it, you should be fine. Don't use it at the same time as you charge it though, it heats up easy, charging or not.

B06W9L7YJM	4	Great Refurbished Smartphone The S5 is still a great phone that can give you a lot for a 5 year old flagship. The look of this refurbished is nearly brand new. Screen was like new. Battery life is strong. But I bought an extra in case. Get the OEM Samsung battery or the Anker replacement. The Verizon bloat ware likes to steal RAM and battery life. It's always been the thorn in the S5's side. Disable as much as you can. Rooting it is likely very tricky, nearly impossible... But this phone comes with Android 6.0, so it is not an ancient interface. I bought this just to use on Verizon network towers thru Straight Talk. I'm no heavy user, but this phone doesn't feel old. 1;	0.0	4.0
B06W9L7YJM	4	Worth the money; Poor battery Everything that you would expect from a good quality cellphone. Good screen resolution/quality (1080p), good speaker (for a cellphone speaker), useful functionalities (extra touch sensitivity, preview of a selection just by hovering your finger over the screen, multi windows, fingerprint lock...), BUT, and an extra but here: The battery... sucks. Don't get me wrong, the cellphone is fantastic, and for the price, it's wonderful!.. For 2 hours that is! Anyway, it charges up at a good pace, so, as long as you have somewhere to plug it, you should be fine. Don't use it at the same time as you charge it though, it heats up easy, charging or not.

B06X9FGTMN	4	Cosmetic issues - scratches & dings along edges/corners Estimated shipping was accurate. I have only had the black iPhone 7+, 128GB for approximately 12 hours & so far so good. Camera, microphone, battery, touch, etc. works well from my findings. You can most definitely see right off the bat that it’s used/refurbished due to very heavy nicks/dings around the edges of the phone. I still gave 4 stars because other than *minor* scuffs (considered cosmetic) everything else seems to be functioning to expectations. I will try to post pics but no promises. 1;	0.3	3.3

If I didn't know better, I would think that it was a brand new phone. It came with an official Apple wall charging brick, and brand new charging cable. I hope that when I surprise my son with it, in two days. It will be a good and lasting replacement for his 4. After I have had it for a week, I will fill in more of the details. As long as this phone has very few defects (if any) I would definitely say this was a very good buy. 1;	0.3	4.6

Price was competitive and actually a bit better than walmart.com with prime shipping. I'm trying to be objective because I don't care for Apple products. No memory expansion is one big reason but also customer support. But it's a nice phone with ease of use high. And the installed or available to install software Garage Band is a nice digital music creator. So my issue with Apple notwithstanding it's a well made product at a competitive price that made the receiver happy so if Apple is your preference it's the deal for you. 1;	0.4	5.0

Note this phone is locked to Boost Mobile, there are other versions of the same phone which will be locked to other providers. Do NOT purchase this phone other than for the Boost Mobile network. My Galaxy J7 Perx is replacing a Samsung Galaxy 5. It has a larger screen, and a longer run time. There is a lot of bloat / spy ware included with the phone (Facebook as an example can't be uninstalled). Google spying just comes with Android, it's built in. There is a fair bit of other junk Boost Mobile included (Instagram and other stuff) which can't be removed, some of it (but not all of it) can be disabled. Many complain the phone is slow. If your phone is slow the cause may be a defective phone OR bloatware. Facebook for example must scan all your gmail messages and phone home, this can take both time and resources. Other products will behave similarly, during the initial \""\""scan\""\"" of your device by the bundled applications the phone may be a bit sluggish.

B06XS2GWFC	4	Could easily be $300 dollar phone. My thoughts afters a couple of months. First off, it is very close in look and feel to flagship smart phone. Secondly, it functions perfectly well and has most of the top end qualities. It's fast enough and the screen is quite nice(more than acceptable). The battery is great and buttons are good. But of course you will notice it doesn't have the same level of storage or camera quality you get at the near $1000 price ranges. Overall it perfect for trying to save money on your new phone without having to sacrifice modern day accessibility.

B06Y2GX8K8	4	Great phone, but I'm annoyed with my Bluetooth problem. This is my first flagship phone and these are a couple things that I immediately noticed improve when I switched from my previous 3 year old ZTE smartphone. (1 month after purchase) -Performance and quality are instantly noticeable. -Pictures look great (front and back camera) -Slow-motion camera is amazing. If you time it just right, you've got yourself an awesome Instagram video. -I don't know why other people complain about the design, but I think it's stylish. -A lot more memory for storage. -I can go at least a day and half without charging my phone. (with Bluetooth on and about an hour worth of YouTube videos throughout my day) My only complaint: -I've had trouble with my Bluetooth connectivity to my car.When I'm listening to music, it sounds like a scratched CD because it skips and lags. My music plays just fine using an AUX cord, and it's not my car's Bluetooth because it never gave me that problem with my previous phone. I've read online that a lot other people have the same issue with other flag ship phones as well. It's really annoying that I have this problem. Minus one star for this.

B06Y2GX8K8	4	Un-updated replacement is better than original.

To my Amazement, the sound on this one is way better. NOTE! I have not run the available SOFTWARE UPDATE wich I did out of the box on the original. I will have to monitor the updates and hopefully they will fix the problem that worsens the sound. Music should have two speakers and speakerphone volume should be loud. I use it for business and I need a LOUD speakerphone. This un-updated unit is okay so I'll keep it. Everything else is awesome. It even seems my LTE reception is improved. 1;	0.0	5.0

B06ZZVZKTR	4	Moto E (4th Generation) - 16 GB - Unlocked (AT&T/Sprint/T-Mobile/Verizon) - Black This unlocked Moto E4 smartphone is very decent and relatively inexpensive with 16 GB of memory and good features for the price. Unfortunately I was unable to find a functional aftermarket SIM card to use it with my current Sprint service and as expected, Sprint Customer Service was of no help at all. I ended up returning the phone and just purchasing one outright from Sprint for about forty-dollars more. Its a great little phone for the price though, so hopefully you'll have better luck than I did swapping or finding an aftermarket Sim card for it or at least a service provider that is more accommodating than Sprint currently seems to be.

B06ZZVZKTR	4	It a great phone for the price It a great phone for the price. My Samsung S4 died ( the battery swelled up and cracked the LCD from behind) and I needed a replacment..Theres no way I am paying almost 1000 bucks for a phone...My S4 was $0.01 since I got a 2 year contract with it...This thing is pretty damn good. The old S4 didnt read websites correclty anymore. The newer phone fixed it. Right off the bat I noticed the camera is not as good as my old phone. The s4 took great pictures in low light...this thing takes grainy pics in low light. In bright light its fine. All the websites operate fine, and the built in FM radio is a nice touch. I haven't had any problems with sim cars or anything...Sometimes the keyboard seems like its glitchy and it presses the wrong letter or no letter at all...but what the hell...for the price I think its a great buy. 1;	0.1	3.9

B071ZDQ6MV	4	Nokia is very promising I wanted a phone that's had good support for updates and security, while I was researching phones I came across the Nokia 6 (2017). At first I was curious how this would perform since there's a 6.1 Version of the phone so I caved in and bought it. My first impression was surprising how nice the material is for this phone and it's pretty decent for playing some games and mutitasking. This Fingerprint is alright it does have its moment when it doesn't read but I'm okay with that.

The display looks very clean, which sadly also highlights how bad the camera is. I don't know how other people are able to take good pictures with this, because whenever I do I have to hold it on focus for a couple of seconds and even then its still blurry and the coloring/lighting is skewed.

B071ZN4K8V	4	Great Phone even in 2018-2019 Great phone...just get one with more GB if you can afford it. My apps take up a lot of storage.

Some companies like Cough Cough Samsung & iPhone dropping one sometimes two every year. Camera is clean, I play a lot of games on my phone.

B071ZN4K8V	4	Worth Taking a Chance Update 2/18/19 - I received my replacement unit over a week ago and have been testing it since. The second phone arrived with a small dent/chip in the upper right corner of the metal frame which indicates it was dropped, but other than that it's in very good physical condition. A case will easily hide the minor damage. The screen is in perfect condition with no scratches, dead pixels, or burn in. On the software side, I am yet to experience a single issue. The phone came with Android 9 and October's security patch which was a good sign. I'm guessing the phone was used through October 2018 and potentially traded in for a Pixel 3 or 3 XL since the time frame aligns with Google's release schedule. The first unit I received came with a two year old version of Android which probably means it was returned as defective early in its life cycle. I now have the phone updated with February's security patch and everything runs silky smooth. The camera works great, the battery holds a lengthy charge, and I haven't experienced any issues with the GPS antenna or speaker like some of the other reviews mention. Overall, this phone is worth taking a chance on especially with Amazon's 90 day refurbished guarantee. I was so happy after receiving my second unit I suggested the phone to another family member who purchased a few days later. She asked me to set the phone up for her when it arrived and it worked flawlessly out of the box. The physical condition was excellent and there were no other issues with the software/firmware other than a number of updates. For $179 or less and Amazon's generous return policy, you really can't go wrong even if you have to go through a few duds along the way. 2/8/19 - This review is for the first unit I received from Prime Mobility which is in the process of being returned. Hopefully the replacement actually works and the phone I sent back is never resold to another unsuspecting buyer unless it’s for parts. The Good - Cosmetically speaking, the phone was nearly a perfect 10. I could not see any physical blemishes on the device other than a tiny scratch near the charging port. The screen was in excellent condition and did not have any dead pixels. The AMOLED display was also free from burn in which sometimes occurs after extended use due to Android's on-screen navigation buttons. It almost seemed like the phone had never been used. The Bad - During the initial set up process, the phone got extremely hot, froze, and rebooted. This happened four times before I could complete the set up and get to the home screen. The phone then got extremely hot when updating the pre-installed apps, froze, and rebooted. This happened two more times. I decided to check for a software update to see if that would correct the issue. Android 9 was available and I began the download process. Shortly after it started, the phone froze again, but this time it did not reboot and was completely unresponsive. I had to do a hard reset by holding the power and volume down buttons. At this point, I thought I would try to do a factory reset so I booted into recovery mode. Instead of being greeted with the normal recovery screen which you navigate with the volume buttons, I had a completely black screen with the little Android guy lying on his back with a red X sticking out of his chest. There were no options whatsoever and the phone was again completely frozen. This time the hard reset didn't work and I could not power down the device. It sat like this for about 20 minutes before it suddenly restarted by itself. I seriously thought I was going to have to wait for the battery to completely discharge before this happened. When the phone finally booted, I took advantage of the opportunity to navigate to the regular settings menu and select the factory reset option. After resetting, I tried going through the initial set up process again. I skipped the Google account activation option and went straight to Wi-Fi setup. After selecting my network, I tried to enter my Wi-Fi password, but the phone froze again and rebooted. I was really frustrated at this point. I eventually got through the set up process for the second time and made it to the home screen, but as soon as I did, the phone restarted again... This time it was stuck in a constant boot loop. The phone would continuously boot, get to the lock screen, and reboot again. Completely unusable. I captured a video of the phone doing this for five minutes straight before I gave up. I have no idea what this phone has been through or how it ended up this way considering it looks great physically. I've been an Android user since the original T-Mobile G1 and have never experienced so many issues outside of flashing custom ROMs, kernels, etc. I currently own another Pixel XL as well as two Pixel 2 XLs which were purchased directly from Google and none of them have ever frozen. I purchased this phone with the intention of sending it to a family member overseas so I'm extremely glad I took the time to play with it before shipping it out. What a disaster. 1;	-0.1	27.3
B071ZN4K8V	4	Better than expected After reading some of the reviews, I was kinda hesitant to buy a refurbished one, but saw that most positive ratings came from people who bought directly from Amazon. The shipping (US to GR) was quite fast, so that was impressive. The phone itself was in very good condition, clean, with no traces of mishandling. The only downside is the fact that the battery life is not as good as expected. On a good day I'll get 4 hours of SOT max., usually it's around 3, with no heavy usage or gaming. Other than that, for the price, I'm quite satisfied. 1;	0.6	4.7

B072KNNF33	4	Overall a Good Value This phone is locked to AT&T. This is exactly what I needed because I have no native AT&T signal at my house and must rely on the wifi calling feature of a genuine AT&T phone. When loaded with an AT&T SIM card, the wifi calling feature works perfectly. The only reason that I did not give this phone 5 stars is because it is not provided with a rapid-charge charger. Yes, a charger is provided, but the one I received was an HTC charger and it does not support rapid charging (even though the phone, and the genuine Samsung charger, do support rapid charging). 1;	0.2	2.5

B072ZWCKP5	4	For the price, this blows an iPhone away. I resisted getting a smart phone until now. I got by with a solid, military grade flip phone, and an iPod touch for years. I was almost always by wifi, so my iPod Touch kept me connected and organized, and my phone took care of calls and texts. I was happy with the combo. Don't get the wrong picture; I enjoy technology. I'm typing this review on a custom built gaming PC. I just don't have a love affair with my phone like so many do today. I've been through two iPod Touch devices, and then Apple discontinued it. My last iPod battery reached its end, so I was out of options. It was time to get a smart phone. Ultimately, it came down to this: Apple products are over priced, and built to fail via OS upgrades or the battery. I couldn't replace the battery myself, and even if I did, the constant OS upgrades would render the iPod Touch useless. iPhones are ridiculously expensive, and the deals that they have with major cell phone carriers aren't deals. They just roll the price of the phone into monthly payments, and/or lock you in. No, thanks. So, Android is the way to go for me, and this Moto E Plus has more than everything that I need. I really like the Google Assistant, it's way better than Siri, and at least as good as Alexa. I especially like that I can use this phone with either Sprint or Verizon by just switching the low cost sim card. More options are better. Also, it looks like the battery is easily replaceable; that's a huge plus when you know that all batteries eventually die. Why would I pay big bucks for the battery limitations of an iPhone? The voice quality is good. The camera and screen are good. The touch screen is responsive. I even saw a video on YouTube where it was submerged in water for a minute, and it survived (don't try this at home). This, and a durable case, is all I need. This will get 4 stars from me for now. If it lasts two years, it will get 5 stars. I really hope it goes the distance. The only downside to this phone is that you won't be able to impress shallow people with your needlessly expensive iPhone. Trust me, you'll live. 1;	0.1	13.6
B072ZWCKP5	4	Screen scratches very easy The screen is very prone to scratches. You must get a screen protector. I tried buffing out the scratches and ended up wearing off the waterproof coating. Overall the phone is a good value android, with a large battery. I use gps quite a bit and the large battery lasts me for the work day without needing to plug in. You could probably get 2 or more days out of it if you do not use gps at all. The only gripe I have is the sluggish UI speed. Games and Things like loading web pages, if you scroll down before it loads completely it turns into a slug. Maybe it’s the cheap cpu or not enough ram, but it’s very sluggish, but it definitely gets the job done, its a good value overall. I’m guessing that there might be some android customizations that will make it move a little bit faster, to lighten the load on the cpu, because even chrome and google maps is pretty slow loading. 1;	0.1	5.1

Of course it is too late to exchange the phone, so my next step is going to be trying to find out what I have to do to get the warranty to either fix it or replace it and I am not happy at all. I've had Sony phones in the past that I totally enjoyed but this is not one of them. 1;	-0.1	2.7

B074VFRKZG	4	Superb phone for the price This is a great phone, and even better at the current price. It has solid build, and feels like a way more expensive phone. It may not have every feature, or the best camera, or the best screen, BUT, if you looking for a budget phone that performs more than adequate, this is it. If you looking for a basic phone that performs well, and carries a charge through the day, has quick charge too, so topping up battery is not an issue. Definitely recommend to anyone looking at a sub $200 phone. 1;	0.5	3.5

B0751RGH6W	4	Great phone! Awesome refurbished phone. It had some scratches (as expected), but nothing a phone cover couldn't cover up. Best phone on the market for the price! So many people upgrade apple products as soon as they release every year, so the refurbished/used olds ones are still nice in my experience.

B07536MYBQ	4	Very nice phone but extra steps for upgrading firmware - If you're not a Verizon Customer. I'm not reviewing the phone Note 8 - there's enough of that. I'm reviewing this Unlocked version and providing some info. 1. The one I received was intended for Verizon and as such, came with all the Vz bloatware and a 'This is not a Verizon Sim card' message when I restart the phone. 2. Turn off and disable the Verizon apps and gimmick features - battery life improves. Sorry, but I'm not telling you which ones - not an expert. It was trial and error for me. 3. I used it with MVNO Ting.com with a GSM Sim - no issues there. 4. When I tried to update the firmware through the Settings menu I kept getting a error message that stated the phone could not be verified. This leads to step 5 5. The way to upgrade the firmware was to plug the USB into a PC, select Software Upgrade from the connection selections (last one at bottom). A new drive appears in Windows. Copy all the files to your PC to a new folder. Install the Samsung drivers and the Update Program. Run the Update program and wait for the download (+4GB) . Make sure you have 15 GB free on the C:\ drive or you get a warning and have to start all over again. Then go through the menus. It will take 30 minutes. 1;	0.0	7.3
B07536MYBQ	4	"Galaxy Note 8 (Factory Unlocked)-->Worth the Money \I bought this phone on Thanksgiving from Amazon on sale for $170 off MSRP. I was on the fence about spending so much money for a phone, but I am glad I made the leap after 5 days of use so far. I am using this phone on Cricket Wireless (AT&T). My previous phone was a Motorola Z Play GSM edition. I loved that phone's battery life, the JBL speaker mod, and the Hasselblad Camera Mod. it truly is the best mid-range phone on the market today (better than Z2 Play)... with one downfall... The camera on the Z Play was mediocre at best. With a 15 month old baby at home to take pics of for family... Forget getting quick, clear snaps. The camera lacked quick focus or quick picture taking and also didnt have OIS or EIS. In other words, the camera is very very disappointing... for anyone considering buying that phone. I wanted to upgrade, so I researched mid range phones like the Z2 Play, the OnePlus 5T, Huawei Mate 9 and other phones for replacing my Z Play. For $5-600.00, I could buy an S8 unlocked that is waterproof and has a better camera than most of the midrange phones on the market. Previously, I owned the Note 2 and Note 4 (Sprint), so I decided to go all in and buy the new Note 8... But this time, factory unlocked so I can use any carrier in the US. Here is my experience with the phone so far: Pros: • Blazing fast Snapdragon 835 (6GB of Ram is perfect with this processor) • Touchwiz has no lag... Unlike the other Notes I've owned • The camera and camera features on this phone are great. Camera is laser fast with taking clear photos/videos, which was what I needed with a toddler running around the house • Display is brilliant and has a Blue Filter to reduce glare and eyestrain • Flashlight brightness can be adjusted • Micro SD card slot is always a plus • Great signal strength, even with Military Grade Samsung Kickstand Case installed. • Waterproof down to 5 ft for up to 30 minutes. Cons: •Battery life is subpar compared to Moto Z Play, even with the Note 8's \""\""Mid\""\"" Battery Saver option enabled. I'll have to further \""\""de-bloat\""\"" this phone. •Downfiring speaker at bottom of this phone is terrible when compared to Moto Z Play with JBL Speakermod • Finger Print Sensor is in a bad location • Non-Removable Battery (always a minus  but all phones have non-removable batteries now) • If you have small hands or have pants with small pockets;"""	0.0	14.8
B07536MYBQ	4	Simply perfect... This phone is just great, the 6gb of RAM makes it incredibly fast, the reason for the 4 stars is the uncertainty of not knowing if I'm affected by the battery bug. But battery life even at full performance mode is awesome 1;	0.8	2.4

B075FKVJV3	4	slow, but mostly clutter free android.. and great call quality I use somewhat high end phones, and I bought this as a temporary phone when my primary one (oneplus 5 broke - dropped it big time). As soon as I did the initial setup and connected to wifi, a whole lot of updates got installed (maybe about 6-8 of them), one after the other, requiring a reboot every time. Was a pain, but I would rather have too many updates than not have anything at all. Great thing also is that the OS is mostly clutter-free, and very few trash application in there. Initial problem I had (I have since moved on to an S9 when I got one on a deal, and this is truly a back up phone) is that it is slow. I haven't used very many phones this cheap, but I am a fairly light user. I dont game or run benchmarks 3 times a day. The only reason I buy more expensive phones is better camera (and not the fastest processor or huge RAM or tonnes of storage). Even with that light usage, I thought this phone was slow. I can get by with it, to be sure, but the sacrifice is clear. It also has very little internal storage - that 8GB runs out quick. I started installing my apps, and about 10-15 apps in (none of them a game), it told me to remove something else before I can install another one :( One thing I have to give it though - the call quality is FANTASTIC. People often used to say my voice is breaking up with my oneplus5, but with this Nokia it never happened. And I could feel the difference myself. Battery lasts quite a bit. I think you can probably go 2 days, especially because you wont be doing much more than talk, given the overall (lack of) responsiveness. 1;	0.0	7.7

B0775FLHPN	4	Good purchase (?) It came in a nice Amazon renewed box only with the charger (the usb cable is not original, only the adapter). Has a few scratches but nothing that can’t be hidden with a good cover. Looks almost brand new and everything works great so far. Will update this review if there’s any problem with the phone. UPDATE 06/19/2019: The phone got stuck in a boot loop after powering off due to low battery. Afterwards it worked normally. Also the apps freeze sometimes, but not too often. UPDATE 03/07/2019: The phone has been working properly and hasn’t had any other issue. 1;	0.2	3.8

B0775FLHPN	4	Phone came in perfect condition. This phone came in great condition with a screen protector already installed. It looked brand new. The maximum capacity for the battery came at 89% but it still lasts all day. It came with a generic cord and an Apple charging block. I activated it on Cricket with no issues, I just put in my Sim card and it was good to go. My only issue is that sometimes applications will force close and won't reopen until the phone is restarted. Sometimes the phone will shut off too. It's not a common thing, so it doesn't bug me too much. I plan on trading this phone in in a couple months to get a new phone. 1;	0.2	3.9

B077WSVG4Z	4	This is a good device. I had the pixel 2 xl for a little less that a month, I change it because I had the opportunity to get the pixel 3 xl for less of what I paid for the pixel 2, this is a phenomenal device, best camera of 2017, excellent battery, Google assistant, why I don't give 5 stars?? The answer is the display, there is an issue with the brightness where is not bright enough, in comparison with my old Nexus 6 where normally I kept it at 50% of bright, the 50% of the pixel was to dark I have to kept it at 70% and even that my Nexus 6 was brighter, for me was a deal breaker and when I saw the opportunity to replace it for the new model I went for it, but is that is not an issue to you, then you would have a phenomenal device in your hands. 1;	0.4	1.9

B077ZKKBDB	4	Android Auto problem fixed, now it is great. Updated review: After not using it for a couple of months, I turned it on because it had my emergency SIM I use when I travel out of T-Mobile range. It loaded a ton of updates, and apparently finally fixed the USB Android auto. I really like it now. The Android Auto issue was the only problem I had with it. Everything else about it works great. A great camera, and it has a shutter button so you don't have to tap the screen. The battery last forever. The display is crisp. One star off for taking so long to fix the problem. The support people are very uninterested in fixing this problem. I got an update sometime in May/June, and it has not worked right since. Android Auto works good for a few minutes and then it locks up. I bought a $180 ASUS phone and it works great all the time. This is clearly a Sony issue. A forum search will show this is a well known problem. An otherwise excellent phone I wish I could use, it has a great camera, nice big display and is quick on most tasks. I bought this phone because it has Oreo, and I needed Android Auto. 1;	0.1	10.1
B0787V183F	4	Amazon refurbished quality seems to be falling Not up to Amazon refurbished standards from the past when I got a phone that was in perfect condition and had over 90% battery life. This phone had a visible scratched screen. You can see the scratch mostly when looking at photos but when web surfing you can't see it. Also unacceptable 75% battery life. There are better and cheaper options available, that have pictures of the phone so you know what you're buying before you get it, from other online stores. The main reason to get it from Amazon is the 90-day return warranty. Other reviewers have mentioned that the phone died after 6 months to a year, well that's not Amazon's fault after the 90-day warranty. Also the pixel 2 has a two-year warranty. So if you find a seller that will work with you on that then you will still have six months to a year left on the two year warranty. 1;	-0.3	4.3

B078P23KVB	4	Perfect 4.7⭐️ (**4⭐️ UPDATE IN DESCRIPTION**) Honestly, I was a little hesitant/skeptic about buying a device let alone a smart device on Amazon especially cuz it said something about 1897 in the title of the name🧐. It was supposed to come around 8pm but arrived 7 hours earlier. No scratches. Came with 99% battery capacity😮🤭🥴. Surprisingly it’s actually an apple device lmao, and it works with Metro PCS. Only thing is Idk about everyone else but I would say it’s more of a cream color than a gold, and my only concern is, it’s rebooted/restarted (turned off then back on) randomly twice since I got it🤔 not sure what it means cuz I don’t think it’s stuck in a boot loop because it’s up-to-date on all updates, but maybe it was nothing 🤷🏻‍♂️ Idk lol but overall I’d say 5/5⭐️ MMMAYBE 4.5 lmao (SC/IG; Sp3ctre.Wolf) UPDATE: 3 stars ⭐⭐⭐ (if not 2.7🤦🏻‍♂️) Yhhh so it'll be a week that I've had this now by tomorrow. But everytime I try and use the camera now through the original software (say for portrait mode, slow mo, video, etc or even open the app at all for that matter) it reboots, like every single time- to the point to where I'm contemplating why this is even a thing. Idk if I should return it, bring it in for a diagnosis or what, but if anyone can help me with this please let me know, 🤦🏻‍♂️ Thanks in advance (COULD) be the recent update🤔 “bootloop”) *UPDATE UPDATE* 2 weeks after purchase So it would turn out that it WAS the phone (apple) and not the seller (obviously) because of the recent 12.4 update🤦🏻‍♂️. I was experimenting with different settings, to see what could’ve triggered it until I tried force rebooting the phone consecutively until I thought it had enough lol. So far I think it’s fixed but if not, ig I’ll update again 🤷🏻‍♂️ lmao. 1;	0.0	4.4
B078RBVVCV	4	"Phone is good but the camera is crap (3.5 Stars really) \After reading some other reviews I knew that the camera was getting negative reviews but the rest of the phone's capabilities and the price point led me to get it. Most of all the battery life is great. I can get two days out of a charge which I could not even get a full day from my Galaxy 7. The processing power is adequate and I don't have sluggish apps etc. Overall the phone is meeting my expectations from a performance standpoint. The camera however, is a sad feature of this phone. It has trouble focusing, the image quality is not great, in fact, its not even very good. The lens stands proud on the back of the phone and ealy get covered in fingerprints. I'm constantly having to wipe it off because it won't focus with fingerprint smudges. The fingerprint scanner on the front works better than my Samsung one did but not as good as iPhone does. It allows for registering multiple users and mulitipe fingers and that is a nice feature but I think that has more to do with Android than the hardware. The hardware though does recognize the fingerprint quickly and reliably. One, kinda creepy, thing is when you turn on the phone and the splash screen comes up a creepy womans voice says \""\""hello moto\""\""  but she says it in a way that feels stalkerish. When I was doing the initial setup on it my wife was in the other room and kept hearing that when the phone restarted a few times and she hollered at me from the other room to stop doing that cause it was creeping her out.\"";"""	0.0	7.6
B078T2T2FL	4	Not bad. The build quality is pretty darn great. I really like the hardware, including the fingerprint sensor, etc. What I don't like? The OS (or, OS overlay). Emui really slows down the phone. Maybe it's just too different than the mostly-stock Android I've been using on my Moto G phones (since generation 2). I dunno .. I find it beautiful, and it seems to have a lot of features, but .. something's lacking. I'm going to return the phone. 1;	0.0	3.3

The only thing that works is home button, back does nothing and it won't give you access to type address or anything.

B078T2T2FL	4	What's not to love? (Edit 09-30-2018: Android Auto doesn't work!) I recently bought a Mate 10 for personal use. I had previously had the original Samsung note, an S4, a Note 4, a Huawei Honor 7X, Huawei 8, Hoawei Mate 9, and now this. I have never been happy with the reliability of Samsung phones. The Note lost the GPS just past warranty, and the S4 had to be replaced several times for various reasons while under warranty. The Huawei 7X wasn't powerful enough for me, though still a reliable phone. The GPS quit working on the 8 just past warranty. I broke the screen on the 9and had it replaced but they say they can't get factory screens for Huawei phones so they replaced it with an aftermarket screen, which I broke within a few months. They replaced it a couple more time because I could only make them last a couple months at a time. Meaning the non-OEM screens are not gorilla glass or any other break resistant glass. If you buy a Huawei phone be very careful so you don't break the screen. Having said all that, I love this phone! Consumer Reports rated it at 78 points with the Samsung S9 being rated at the top with 81 points and several other Samsung and Apple phones between that and this Mate 10. The deal breakers are that this phone can be had for $500 on Amazon, while the other phones run between $600-1000, and the battery life on this phone is really pretty amazing (As well as on my previous Mate 9). I am a heavy user and it rarely gets below 60% at the end of the day. The camera is pretty sweet, better than the Mate 9, which was good in it's own right. The 'Merican Mate 10 only has one sim slot and no extra slot for memory, though it DID come with 128g of ram and 6 gigs for the operating system. There is literally zero lag ever. They make their own CPU which is probably why they can sell this phone cheaper, rather than having to buy them from the same place the other makers do. See attached photos; One of the lenses is B&W and it's pretty impressive. It's fun to experiment! As for reliability, I'm more impressed with these phones than the ones made by Samsung, more so since they cost half of a comparable Apple or Samsung phone. My Mate 9 still works like a clock even though I drop it about once a day and have broken several screens. I hope this one does as well. Edit: 9-30-3028: There is one downside for Huawei phones in general, and the Mate 10 Pro is no exception. It will not work with Android Auto that is in newer cars, including my 2017 Dodge Charger Daytona. This is my fourth Huawei phone and none of them has worked with AA. I emailed them about this and they sent a curt reply that their phones are not compatible. When queried by news organizations they have stated that they are working on a fix. However, they have been saying this since 2016. Meaning, don't buy a Huawei phone if AA is critical to you because they may never fix it. One star removed for that. Otherwise, it's a great phone. 1;	0.0	15.9

B079C1K282	4	It's worth it for $345 (Panda Version 128gb) I was a little skeptical at first because the device is 'refurbished' - but to my surprise, everything turned out great. The Box: Although not the original - it was all white, came in great condition, and surprisingly with the original charging brick/cable. The Device: To put it simple; it looks brand new. However, the screen had a few scratches on it; as if it was placed in a pocket with a set of keys. The scratches appear to be isolated in the top right hand corner of the device. I've been using the device just under a week now and haven't had any noticable issues with it. I've used: Bluetooth WiFi LTE Took pictures and videos with front and rear cameras Had phone calls Did ALL updates Watched movies Played games From a software and hardware stand point, this phone has zero issues. The Verdict: Presentation was nice 👌 Device is almost perfect (lose points for scratches on screen) Original chargers in box Software and Hardware seem to work as intedned with no issues.

My main frustration wit it is, in the last few weeks. My phone has started to freak out and it will shut off. I have no idea why other than it thinks I'm asking it too much? Most of the time it happens is if I'm listen to music and trying to post something on instagram. Or something of that nature. Its frustrating when this happens because I have to wait an extra few minutes but it also deletes the stuff I was working on. It did it once in my sleep though and I was late for class. It wasn't working hard over night, so I'm not sure why its been doing this. It has been almost 6 months and it's starting to happen every few days. 1;	-0.1	6.4
B079Z792J7	4	A Solid Phone Runs fairly smooth with a near stock Android experience- the Moto gestures (chopping the phone to turn on the flashlight or twisting it to activate the camera) are very handy as well, I find myself wishing other phones would incorporate the gestures. The ability to expand memory with a Micro SD card along with a headphone jack are always great additions. The phone is a beautiful design, in my opinion. The glass back gives it a nice heft, but it is glass- mine has a hairline fracture on it. The camera is fine; though there are much better ones out there. 1;	0.4	3.0
B079Z792J7	4	Moto G6 2018 phone. Very nice good quality and nice camera This is a very nice phone. Purchase two as a gift. nicely made, modern look good camera. For the price it’s an awsum phone. Call quality from the receiver side is clear and nice. From caller side I’ve been told no issues. I cannot comment on the battery life as of yet, I’ve received no feed back. Over all phone was not loaded with all the bloatware. Clean phone with just the google apps. Not an iPhone by any means but a great android phone. 1;	0.4	7.8
B079Z792J7	4	Warning, The 3 phones I ordered are NOT set up for Sprint This is a great phone for the price. However, the phones I received are not setup properly to be setup on the Sprint network. It sounds like it's not a hardware issue, but a phone company setup on the backend. Amazon was not able to help other than returning the phone(s) so I'm working with Motorola. Hopefully they'll be able to help me given that this phone *should* be able to run on the Sprint network. 1;	0.0	1.3
B079Z792J7	4	Beautiful display, but that memory tray... It is indeed a beautiful and powerful phone that is definitely worth its price. the only pet peeve I've found is the impracticality of its sim card/flash memory tray; I've struggled to open it since I got it. but aside from that, it is a pretty cool device. 1;	0.5	2.9
B079Z792J7	4	Good for the price For the money I don't think you can go wrong would it handle a drop I don't so. So I would buy a good case. Only problem I have is with how long it took to get ready for shipping when in stock 5 days is to slow 1;	0.5	1.6

B07B81WJRQ	4	Great size, quiet speakers Great phone. I love the form factor and how it fits in my pocket. Unlocking with my fingerprint is awesome and it feels like the sensor is in just the right spot. A few small problems that prevent it from being five stars: sometimes my hand triggers the very edge of the touch screen when I am holding the phone or reaching across to touch the other side. The speakers are WEAK for media playback, you can barely hear them on full volume if you're in a place with moderate background noise like in a car. 1;	0.3	4.2
B07B81WJRQ	4	Lose feel. Love the phone size. Owend it for about a year. I can put my phone in any pocket and never noticed it was there. Con the back is rounded. And I have dropped this phone more times than any phone I owned. And that's dating back to 1999. And how small the phone is I wish I could get more life. Playing games, watching videos and surfing the web will last me a day. Hope this helped. 1;	0.1	2.7
B07B81WJRQ	4	Heavy but good otherwise I really want to like this phone. I'm a big fan of smaller phones and there isn't a lot of choices out there. The compact size is ok though a bit smaller would have been preferable. Performance wise its fast and easy to setup. The camera is decent. The thing that drops this to 4 stars is how heavy it is. This is supposed to be a compact phone, but the weight makes it feel a lot bigger than it is. It's also thick. Other than the weight, the phone is great. Fast, camera works great, and the battery lasts forever. And I have had no problems with the fingerprint sensor or using the ATT network in the US. 1;	0.4	5.8

B07BBT5MMD	4	A great deal I liked the S9 but hesitated to drop $600 on one. This phone is as promised. It works well and I had no trouble getting it working. It is even smart enough to transfer all of my apps and files wirelessly. I was done in 10 minutes. I had to get a new sim card, this is nano sim and my old was a micro.

B07C57L57V	4	A great but one problem I have had this phone for over a month and I think it is a great buy for the money, I only have one problem with it and that is the fingerprint scanner.

B07C5HH17G	4	The best phone I've owned so far. I generally steer away from buying apple, Samsung, or Google products, so one of the major brands I was left with was Huawei. I did a lot of research into which one I should buy and a settled on the p20 lite. Ever since I bought it it has been an absolute pleasure to use. The android skin is one of the best I've used so far, the cameras are amazing, and the speed in most applications is great too. One thing that does happen, however is the phone will freeze. It only happens like once every 2 or 3 months, but still an issue. Also snapchat is terrible on it, but that is no fault of Huawei, it seems to be an optimization issue that only snapchat itself can fix. The only thing I wish they did differently was make the battery more accessible because I might need to replace it in a year or so. Also love the headphone jack! 1;	0.3	5.8
B07C5HH17G	4	Nice midrange phone. Slow processor. I bought this phone around 4 or 5 months ago and it's a pretty nice mid range phone. This sakura pink color looks a lot better in person. It's a bit lighter than what the renders show. It also has a glittery effect. I love the design and it has some pretty great cameras too. The selfie cam is probably one of the best I've used in a while and you can even do bokeh effect on it. Low light shots are pretty decent on both front and back cameras. My only gripe about the phone is the processor. It will stutter and lag for about 3 seconds. It already froze on me a couple of times to the point of where I had to reset it. EMUI isn't the best launcher either but of course you can cha ge that by downloading a launcher from the play store. After the April security update, gesture navigation is also enabled so you won't have to use the on screen soft keys to navigate around the phone. If it wasn't for the huawei ban, I'd definitely recommend this phone. It's uncertain whether or not this phone will get the EMUI 9/Android Pie update so it's still stuck on oreo. EDIT: It looks like the battery has been draining a lot quicker than before. It also heats up on the top section of the phone. 1;	0.1	10.4
B07C5HH17G	4	nice. really wish it was waterproof/resistant. I mostly really like it. I really wish it was waterproof, and that the fingerprint reader was on the front. I miss physical home buttons. was just more convient for me, but those are hard to find now (g6 seems to do it pretty well, and the fingeprint reader has gestures? this one does too, a little bit) i wouldn't have complained about the notch. not looks cool to me, but its so damn hard to read. reading battery % and the time in my car, so hard to do. maybe its the fonts they use. 1;	0.1	3.5

B07C5HH17G	4	Best value for your money. First I have to say I love this phone. I had the p8 lite for a little while but decided I wanted a newer phone. Now I can't see my self buying anything other than Hawuei phones. EMUI is a smooth overlay and the phone is great for the price. My one complaint is that it isn't the best for games because of the older cpu used. It will play games without issue but sometimes you have to lower settings. I hear there is an update planned to fix that issue tho! 1;	0.5	5.4

B07C65VV3R	4	No issues, seller is legit Phone is fine, nothing special, GPS seems off, assuming because it is refurbished. Looks new, no problems. Still says Verizon on it, but works fine on Sprint. At first Sprint said the phone couldn't be hooked up, but that is simply because their agents are very poorly trained, I have never gotten a correct answer feom a single Sprint call center agent in the 15 years I have had them. Just take it directly to a Sprint store and they can hook it immediately. Soon any phone you buy should work with any carrier anyways. Seller is fine, Samsung is just becoming greedily priced. There are actually better brands that are still unknown and 1/3 of the price out there. For instance Umidigi. Got this one simply because the fam wanted it due to being used to the brand. I would purchase from this Vendor again. 1;	0.1	4.0

B07C65VV3R	4	Works amazing The item arrived about 3 days before the date it said it would arrive.

B07C65XFBB	4	Nice phone This renewed black 64GB S9 is from BREED. It arrived on time and looked good except for a small scuff mark on the screen which you can't see when the phone is on. Ours arrived as advertised with a wall charger and cable and was in fact unlocked with no carrier logos displayed. We popped in the nano SIM card from my wife's S6 along with a 128GB mSD card and it came right up. My wife's 5 year old S6 served her well but the camera and fingerprint reader have stopped working. We've had this S9 for two days and hope it serves her as well.

B07C65XFBB	4	A good phone for the money Went from an Iphone to this because I wanted the extra storage and ability to upload easily to my PC.

I can get about two days out of it before recharging. Video processor is a little slower than the Iphone but still excellent.

This Amazon Renewed 64gb iPhone 8 Plus battery is at 94% but has a fairly scratched up screen that was covered by a fresh screen protector upon receipt. FWIW, an out of warranty screen repair on this phone is $169 from Apple, so it’s actually cheaper to buy from Apple as a Certified Refurbished if you want an absolutely pristine “renewed” iPhone because those phones get brand new batteries and new screens. Still haven’t decided if I’ll keep this one. For me, the cost savings just doesn’t quite make up for the screen being this scratched. 1;	-0.1	1.4

I was worried about what the quality was going to be and if it was going to he everything I read about it being. Well I'm glad I did order it. For the price it is unbelievable the quality of the phone. There are a few things about the OS like where the clock is, the volume settings separated between alarm media and ringtone are a little wonky, doesn't have an app tray ( but can easily download a new launcher out of the app store), and a couple other very picky little things. Overall I am very happy with the phone.

Battery life is starting to feel the age now after a year.

B07G8VPHG3	4	Great smartphone! I bought this smartphone for my wife, and I am very pleased with its performance. It is very responsive, the display looks great and the fingerprint sensor works really fast and accurately. Some cons would be that the pictures quality is not as good as I would expect for a phone of this price. Additionally, if you buy the blue version (as I did) have in mind that the blue tone on its back is not as soft as it looks in the description, it is actually a bit more saturated. 1;	0.3	3.7

B07GS272K7	4	Not a bad phone for the price I used it for over a week now, and so far, I'm pretty satisfied. The phone runs smoothly, have a really nice screen, great colors, it really does gives amazing images. The speakers are impressive, clear definitions, I have a total blast using it to listen to music during my shower time. It might feel like the outdoor mode has better sound, but that doesn't make its normal mode any worse. You can definitely rely on this as a speaker when you go outside, I planned to buy a bluetooth speaker for my phone, but with this I feel like that won't be needed. And for people who likes to game on your phone, you can believe that this phone will run those with no problem. That is unless you're that one person who opens tons of tabs on google chrome and never closes them after they're done. Those were the pros, now the cons - Battery life despite having 4000mAh, it still runs out faster than my older phone, the Samsung J7 2016 with 3500mAh. I don't use it any differently from my Samsung J7, I still set the same level of brightness, use the same amount of apps, yet it still happens. Not sure what the cause behind it, but the difference isn't that big (noticeable but not too bad to cause a problem) so I just accept it. - The fingerprint sensor might not be that good. First time setting up the phone, it didn't take my fingerprint after I'm done setting up, despite I was sure that I did everything right, which led me to having to unlock it with another method, delete the registered fingerprint, and do it again. Now, it works around 85% of the times, sometimes it doesn't take it and I have to try it again 2 or 3 times. - Sim slot is a bit hard to get access to - The side port cover is quite a silly design. To access the side port (for side charging, or to use the accessories like the fan), the cover needs to be taken off completely, and it's a really small piece of rubber that can just go missing the moment you take an eye off it. They fix it by giving you 2 extra pieces in the box... - The phone can get a bit heated during games. Even with the fan that they gave you connected to the phone, you can still feel it clearly getting a bit warm. Not to the alarming level though Some of the cons were just nitpicking, This phone, is still a great phone for the price, so you can rely on it with no worry 1;	0.1	9.5
B07GS272K7	4	Apple Sheep perspective: My favorite Android Phone. I've been in the Apple ecosystem for many years for work but I usually also own an Android phone as well with a different sim as my personal phone line, to stay up to date with Android, I work in IT and I want to make sure I know both OS properly. The ASUS ROG is not perfect, but let me tell ya, I even sold my S9+ for that thing. I think most people covered the pros so I'll I've my cons: - No water resistance - Camera is not up to par to other expensive flagships, although it's still pretty decent. - No wireless charging Thank you Asus for innovating.

B07H41NB46	4	Using Poco from Mississippi with AT&T From the packaging you can tell it was new and unused when it came in, however it did come with a European charger, but I can simply take the cord and use it with a different adapter (Samsung fast charger) for it to get a quick Fu charge. The performance of the phone is great, picture quality, speed, display, storage etc is all great! DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE GETTING THIS PHONE. 4G LTE works only with AT&T. You cannot stream Amazon videos, Netflix, or Spotify on this device. None of those I do so it doesn't effect me.

If you are looking for a phone to be your sole camera this isn't it, but it does great for record keeping and such. Other reviews have mentioned the difficulty in finding a case for this phone. Because this is the international version of the phone the dimensions are different from the American model. I did find a case that fit well, but it was for the E5 Play GO.

B07HD2X91Q	4	Android One Is the Selling Point Getting updates directly from Google was the deciding factor for me picking this phone. When it arrived, I immediately updated to Android Pie. I have read reviews of it lagging, but those reviews were with Androind Oreo. I haven't have any instances where it seemed slow, and nothing has hung up yet. So, for the price point, it has performed very well for me. I have an one issue with the camera, which is a specialized need and I can't really hold it against the phone in a review. I use my phone at work, and the camera does not focus well on very small electronic components. These components are smaller than a pencil eraser, and I can understand that would not be a design goal for a phone. My previous Windows phone did very well in this respect, but didn't get them any market share for excelling with that feature. Using the camera for more general purposes is fine. It is not a flagship phone, but it is maximized for the amount of money it costs. 1;	0.0	5.6
B07HD2X91Q	4	I cannot believe a $250 phone is this good. I cannot believe a $250 phone is this good. Display is amazing, battery life is above average, build quality is impeccable, it's slim and high end feeling, almost too dainty, but really nice. Camera is above average for a budget phone, slightly below average for a high end phone, but serviceable and acceptable. Clean android, with guaranteed timely software updates for 3 years thanks to android one program. There is absolutely nothing I can complain about for this price. It's hands down the best cell phone value I've ever experienced. I highly recommend this phone for the build, software, camera, and performance at the price point. I'll never again but a flagship phone after experiencing the quality here. Brief update... I do notice hiccups and lag in the daily use of the device. I am still happy with it, however there are other inexpensive phones that do not have this issue. See any Moto G phone ever. For this I've knocked my rating down to 4 stars. 1;	0.3	8.2

B07HK4JNV1	4	Phone bricked during firmware upgrade. - There is a way to fix it. I bought this phone based on reviews at Amazon. Yesterday phone prompted for a firmware update and I said ok to update. After the update phone does not turn on. Called amazon tech support and xiaomi with no luck to revive the phone. I remember the firmware upgrade showing about 52 % then suddenly phone went off by itself as if the firmware upgrade aborted or something. amazon will give a refund for phone. sending it back. Never used the phone. Did not even put a sim card in it. Was getting ready with latest software and then this happens. Shouldn't xiaomi do some check sum for they are pushing bug free version of firmware to playstore and shouldn't phone verify the firmware it downloaded is good before it is applying ? There were several warnings not to touch power button during firmware upgrade. But what to do if phone goes off by itself during upgrade and becomes a brick by itself. My first and last purchase of Xiaomi phone. Update 06/11/2019. I am changing my review from 2 star to 4 star because the hardware of phone really is good only the firmware upgrade over the air went bad and bricked it - however there is a way to fix it. I did some google searches and found good copy the firmware is available at https://en.miui.com/download.html downloaded Redmi Note 6 Pro Latest Global Stable Version Fastboot File Download to my computer. Also downloaded the MIUI ROM Flashing Tool to my computer and installed it. Installed winzip and uncompressed the firmware. Pressed power button and volume down button together on phone to get fast boot prompt on phone. Connected phone to computer, via USB cable, ran the flashing tool, selected the source directory where uncompressed firmware is located. Then clicked flash button. This tool flashed or replaced the damaged firmware on phone with a good copy of firmware. It took a several minutes. But phone booted fine and good since then. https://en.miui.com/ website has all these instructions how to manually flash the firmware but you need some back ground too for doing this. Anyways happy that phone case and screen protector that i bough for this phone does not go waste if I were to return the phone for a full refund. Told Amazon I am keeping the phone. It is on Andorid 10.3.3.0 Stable and going forward I will not ok to auto update over air (wifi). Keeping one star less for the trouble I had to go thru to revive this phone. 1;	-0.1	10.2
B07HK4JNV1	4	I Call Mine XiaoLin!!! And it kicks ass! It's been a month now since I started using my RedMi Note 6 Pro. I'm a mere user so I cant say much about its specs except that this is my first cellphone with over 32gm ROM on board complemented with 4 gb of RAM. It feels dainty and luxurious for me, the color is not glaring but it is pretty (pink rose). The grip is firm and secure. It comes with a complimentary TPU casing with a mounted screen protector. With its about 4000mAmps of battery, it does not weigh as much. I have no intention of testing its resistance to shock, water or extreme temperature (I don't $200 to throw away), but I notice it is reasonably sturdy. As a phone it does not disappoint. The clarity is exceptional and the speaker phone is clear, delivering almost natural voice. The pre-installed apps can be annoying but as soon as I got a handle of them, I would say they work. If did not need them, I can turn them off. In the first weeks of use, I notice that it takes way more ads than my previous unit. But it also comes with an option in Settings to turn these ads off. So far, it's been quiet. The display is great to amazing and the cameras are good to very good. It increased my connectivity for portable hot-spot to less than a minute and the streaming have been way better than with my last phone. I'm new to cellphone gaming and I downloaded through its hot-spot capability some games like Shadow Fight 3, Modern Combat 5, Mobile Legends BangBang, Highway Sniper, Epic War, and Modern Warplanes. They all seem flow through seamlessly, even while running its portable hotspot and opened a couple of URLs at the background. To top all these, and other running apps, I am using the Total Launcher - Star Trek Interphase as theme for this phone, a rather beautiful but top-heavy mobile theme. Its battery life is good. I don't normally use my phone a lot at work, but when I need to log-in to my classes, I use Redmi's portable hotspot fairly through the day. I work on flexi-time as a counselor, and often, I get to work around 830 and be home around 8 or 9pm. I may be wiped out but the phone has at least 25-35% power remaining. I dont charge it straight instead intermittently, keen on keeping at least about 90% power available before I report to work. XiaoMi's RedM Note 6 pro is an excellent product. I'm planning to get my wife and my kids the same if not the more recently updated version of the phone. My Xiaolin is better than I thought it is going to be. 1;	0.3	13.7
B07HK4JNV1	4	Great phone for the money once it's rooted. This phone has everything I want except NFC and water resistance.

B07HK4JNV1	4	Almost perfect $200 budget phone! this review comes after two months of use. i like the dual selfie and rear cams. pic quality is great for this price point. Dual sim is great for me as I need texts from offshore. i am using it on T-mobile and i get bands 2, 4 and 5. No band 12 which limits my coverage range esp. in outer or older suburbs, else I would have used this as my main phone. Get a sturdy case n screen protector for your Xiaomis coz it is what it is. It is less likely to survive everyday drops. The stock case that comes with it is useless. For screen protector, you can make do with Iphone 7/8 plus. Not perfect fit but better than none. 1;	0.3	6.3

B07HKPMFZ5	4	Save over $200 When choosing this product over the official Google product, for a while I was unsure if I wanted to save the money and get a non-official Google product cause to me I love the presentation of products and everything with it. But I chose this product over it as after the unboxing process all it would be is a box in my room. My product, unlike other reviews, came with all Google licensed accessories, excluding the pixel buds, and an adapter. Product appears new, no scratches, no previous use or wear associated with it. Great phone as well. No complaints so far. I've turned off most of the extras as it drains the battery a lot. Great adaptive battery life, some days with 2 full days of use, and some just a day if I'm using it for a lot. I did buy headphone adapters as I still have some auxiliary cable products. Save your money, its worth it. 1;	0.1	5.1
B07HKPMFZ5	4	mostly what was advertised received a like-new Pixel 3...however it is a Version Pixel 3 (which means the eSIM is disabled :( ) and the bootloader was unlocked...this actively disables features such as Google Pay. Anyway, was able to image the phone with images from Google and re-lock the bootloader. Be careful re-locking the bootloader without knowing if the original images are in place....otherwise, the phone may stop booting. 1;	-0.1	1.2

B07HQTWQVT	4	Great phone with some minor issues I didn't want to go the Samsung/Apple latest greatest route as I just can't justify the cost anymore. I wanted to find a cheaper Android alternative that was a bit smaller form factor with decent performance and niceties such as fingerprint sensor and NFC (for Google Pay). The Xperia XA2 is a nice phone with distinctive styling that makes it stand out from the rest. It is a bit less tall and wide although a bit thicker and a tad heavier. The added thickness accommodates the battery, which provides excellent life. With moderate use throughout the day, I still have 70% life left. As mentioned prior, the NFC was important to me as I have become rather accustomed to mobile payments like Apple Pay or Samsung Pay. I have to say that Google Pay is even easier to use than its competitors...just unlock the phone and it's ready to use. After starting the phone the first time it went through some updates and is now on Android 8. The phone is snappy with no lag. The volume through the headphone jack is sub-par, but is pretty decent through its speaker. Bluetooth sound is quite good as well if not a bit too bass-heavy. I'm still working on getting decent photos with the camera although I think that is the user and not necessarily the camera. The phone works great. Calls are clear and the phone, contacts, and messaging apps all work well. The phone uses the Swiftkey keyboard and you can also use Google voice transcription. This is a feature that is a little kludgy. You can't easily switch between the two...it takes a few touches to toggle each. The fingerprint sensor worked great the first few days and now is a little finicky. It is like any other sensor where your finger needs to be clean, dry, etc. However, even when my finger is clean and dry, the phone refuses to recognize my print. The more I try, the more it resists until it locks me out. Fortunately, I had set it up to use either the fingerprint or pattern so I can at least get into the phone. The other finicky piece is the cellular and Wifi functionality. It mostly works great until it doesn't. I have a minimum of three bars of LTE and the phone complains there is no Internet. This can happen even with Wifi connected so I'm hopeful this is a software issue that a future update will address. A reboot will usually fix the problem so it's an annoyance but depending on when it happens can be a real pain. Taking everything into consideration I am pretty happy with the phone. If a software update fixes the fingerprint sensor and cellular/wifi issues, this easily gets a five star rating. 1;	0.2	13.6

B07J4Z9647	4	Budget body with This is actually a pretty cool phone. I had a LG G5 which is a pretty awesome device to this one.

It does come with some bloat ware but that may turn out to work in favor of it. I was very skeptical and watched a lot of videos before landing on this so if your in the market for a budget smart phone that has solid specs then this may be the device for you. 1;	0.4	4.2

B07JFTCMV3	4	This is a good smartwatch and a great buy at this price. First Review (after two days): This watch is beautiful and does everything as expected. It has an eSIM which is very nice. There is no need for ordering a SIM card, etc. with this device and it can be activated over the phone with AT&T. Cost was amazing low at $10/month, unlimited. There are many types of replacement bands available for this watch so that is nice. The downside to any Samsung watch is that they chose to use Tizen instead of Wear for the OS. This means that you are locked into the Samsung world of limited apps and limited online services. You will have to have a Samsung account. I feel this is a huge mistake. Wear OS has many more applications and Google online services cannot be beat. Be aware that you can setup the watch up for limited use but will need a cell phone to fully set up this device. The watch will be paired with only one phone. I have a Samsung phone (and do not know this for sure) but suspect that you must have a Samsung phone to make this work seamlessly. The phone is not required for the watch to operated independently after that. 1;	0.2	6.8
B07JMPGNHK	4	great budget phone Was testing this phone out as a daily user. It came with great specs for the money. The snapdragon 660 processor performed very well for such a low budget phone. The phone felt snappy for the price which was a plus. The draw back was the outdated android OS, the front facing camera was terrible compared to higher budget phones like the Poco f1. The selfie camera was actually very good. The AI tech that goes with the camera's wasn't all that great. That being said this was a very good phone for the price. and would recommend this phone to anyone looking for the best bang for your buck.. 1;	0.3	6.3

As a previous owner of Samsung and LG products such as the LG v30,V20 LG G5, G4, G3 Note 8, S7 Edge, S6, Note 5,Note 4,3,2 and Og note as well as a nexus 4 phone.l, I can say this is the most Beautiful phone I've used, even though the screen isn't Amoled or oled the ips display is amazing. The LG V20 I owned can't compete with this screen the brightness of the Huawei is around 800Nits, brighter than the note 8 and oh man the performance of the mate 20 blows the Note 8 away. The kirin 980 cpu is as close as you can get to the new snapdragon on the s10. Camara is better than my Note 8 and good enough for mobile use. Over all its a great phone a cheaper S10 replacement. 1;	0.3	4.2

Good thing is, its BOE screen, so no green problem. Bad thing is, this product is for The Netherlands market. It does not include screen protector, or case. The worst is the charger is for Netherlands/EU market. Seller includes an adapter but its super lose, total not usable. I bought P10, P20, P20 Pro from Amazon before, all come with proper screen protector, a clear case, and most important, a charger with proper plugs. I guess the black color of the packing box instead a typical white color, is a sign for it. 1;	-0.2	4.9

B07K64PTLP	4	Amazing tech for the money, meh connectivity screen quality is amazing. Phone is super fast large amount of RAM. the one generation old top-of-the-line processor the phone can handle anything you throw at it. The in screen fingerprint sensor is good but it's a little finicky, if the screen isn't super clean it struggles. The UI is actually pretty good, and the form factor of the phone is beautiful. camera quality is far superior to what I was expecting low-light image qualaity and video quality surprisingly good. the phone either seems to have issues connecting to the listed LTE bandwidth or doesn't connect at all. Certain areas it would say I have full LTE but would show no connection when trying to use it. I checked the listed LTE bandwidth against my cell provider, and location, and there should have been no issues. I always had cell service was always able to make phone calls send texts, but SMS was an issue using the maps which struggle sometimes. I can't give the phone a terrible review for that, but obviously we buy cell phone so that we can use them on the go. For the money I would still highly recommend this phone just make sure that you double check the cell bands in your area, it might be a risk. 1;	0.2	7.8

B07KNB1TN8	4	Phone was EXACTLY what I wanted. . . .However, sadly it was a PPD I LOVED the phone, when it arrived. I called Sprint and notified them that I had a new phone that I had purchased out-right somewhere else. She had me go through the process of getting set-up but when she had me go into the setting to view the IMEI number, the number was all zeros (000000000000). So she suggested I go into one of the local stores for further assistance because it wasn't making any sense to her. I went in and the technician took it back for about 15 to 20 minutes and after pulling his supervisor in, he discovered it was a PPD Pre-paid phone. I needed a Post-paid phone because Sprint does not do Pre-paid. So unfortunately I had to return the phone. My excitement was soon shattered :-( But I've since found a really good deal with Best Buy and that's where I'm headed next after my refund has been credited back to my account. 1;	-0.1	4.0

Knowing the LTE DOES NOT WORK with T-mobile nor Straight Talk, I took the risk. First impression: The phone is well packages and phone is aesthetically pleasing. If you're familiar at all with the Android platform, nothing is different. Phone is wicked responsive along with the facial recognition works very well. The only con there is that the it doesn't work on band 12 for the LTE, which kills my signal in some areas and especially in buildings. If it weren't for that, I would've kept the phone. 1;	0.0	5.2

B07L4WRXXT	4	Stop waiting, BUY THIS! You'll love it. This is my second Huawei product. I like that for the price point, you get a phone that can stand up to higher priced phones from the Big Three. I tend to abuse my phones as I'm a maintenance man and my phones are exposed to dust, vibration, and scratches and drops. Screen: decent resolution. Has features such as blue light reduction. I'd suggest getting a screen protector as my last Huawei phone was prone to small scratches. Standard protections should be fine. In the middle of the screen. At the top, the camera is located. Occasionally content is blocked in this upper area. As if the screen doesn't take in account that the camera is located here. Minor, minor issue. Only a problem occasionally when looking at PDF blueprints and manuals. Body: I believe it's glass. I could be wrong. But it is beautiful. I love the placement of the fingerprint reader. I added my two pointer fingers and a secondary finger. Even if I scratch up my hands or have glue on them, it's fast and responsive. Having the third offset finger really helps in this. Camera: I haven't used the camera as much as my Huawei Mate, but so far it's AI camera is of quality. Very sharp and detailed images. I'm able to zoom in front distance and take pictures of small lables from a distance. My hands shake sometimes (medical issues, chemical exposure) and the sharpening mode really helps. Specially when zoomed in on text. Wifi/mobile data: There are some areas where I wish the antenna was stronger. The Huawei mate seems to have a faster connection. This may be due to the Mate being a version focused to the USA, and the 8x being an international version. Due to the restrictions the U.s. gov is trying to put on Huawei phones. But, in normal use, I don't have any issues. Occasionally Bluetooth fails, but turning it off then back on, it works perfectly. This may be more to do with my car's connection, and not an actual problem with the phone. I just noticed it happens with Huawei phones more than my old Samsung. All in all, it's an excellent phone for most uses. Get a case. Get a screen protector. You'll be 100% happy with it. I just abuse phones so I'm slightly more critical. I really wish major brands got hip to the game and made a more durable case. I'd love something with more shock proof functions. 1;	0.2	18.5
B07L4WRXXT	4	Pay less and get better features This was a gift for sister. She wanted to buy Galaxy S10 but I recommended Huawei Honor due to following reasons. It is the best price that you pay less but you get better features. It is long battery Life that you do not need to recharge all the time for this big screen phone. She called me that she loves it very much. If I changed my phone, I would go to Huawei. 1;	0.4	3.5
B07L4WRXXT	4	Features and duability Brought this phone to replace my Honor 5x. Had the 5x for 3 years.

B07MF3JM4T	4	Good Phone I bought this phone as an upgrade from my iPhone 6s that was aging and really beginning to slow down in performance. The Moto one phone came as advertised and the ATT rep at the store set the phone up in 5-10 minutes. Battery life is good and touch screen is responsive. Some apps are a little slow but that's different after upgrading to Android 9. This is a good buy. 1;	0.5	3.2

B07MF3Y8Y5	4	Good phone. Easy to use. Fingerprint detection is not user-friendly This phone has had great battery life. It is easy to charge. I have been able to download a good amount of apps with the storage provided. The sound quality is good, the speakerphone feature is clear. The pictures are great. It connects well with T-mobile. My only complaint is more of a quandary...why would the company waste time and money putting a fingerprint detection/unlock feature that is poorly designed? The fingerprint pad is tiny and awkward and rarely detects fingerprints. I rarely, if ever, even try to use this feature anymore. Compared to other phones we own with the fingerprint detection, the moto definitely undershines them all. Otherwise, this phone has been great for our needs and purposes. 1;	0.4	8.0
B07N11SM58	4	"Not Good enough to be a flagship phone \I've been waiting for Nokia to make a true flagship phone. After a few weeks of using it, I am really satisfied with the overal quality of this phone, but I would talk about the downside of this phone. It has nice cameras. All the good reviews are talking about the cameras, and they are really that good. But the bugs of the camera app was pissing me off: 1. The app sometimes randomly popped out a \""\""cannot connect to the camera\""\"" error and I don't know why. I guess it's a software problem yet to be fixed. 2. It lags. Open the camera app need 1 sec  swithing to different mode (e.g. photo to square) takes 1 sec;"""	0.0	5.0
B07N11SM58	4	Go for it So far I'm enjoying my Nokia 9. Picture quality is excellent and it has enough storage. I wish Nokia can include their own apps like gallery, media player, some call and sms filtering apps. Overall I will recommend this for anyone looking for something decent but reasonably priced. 1;	0.6	3.4
B07N11SM58	4	Nice camera, headphone output not loud enough Nice phone. You sacrifice some more recent, kind of frivolous features on favor if the camera array. Seems like a reasonable trade. It captures RAW so you either have to manage your captures or turn off RAW. My biggest gripe is that it has no headphone plug. Instead there's a USB-C dongle with a plug. It doesn't get loud enough. 1;	0.2	3.0
B07N4M412B	4	Good solid phone. Started in Spanish. Works pretty well, it's not supposed to be the international vs so I'm not sure why it was automatically in Spanish and I had to switch a few things to have it revert to USA English. A few of the app folders it created were also in Spanish but were simple to rename . The finger print scanner is a little finicky but I think it will just take some getting used to and the face scanner is annoying since it's 50/50 if I'm wearing glasses or contacts but I was pleasantly surprised that it still works. The camera and resolution is absolutely fantastic. And I love the one handed option in Samsung products since I hate how big phones have gotten making it hard for me to use with my small girl hands . 1;	0.5	4.3
B07N4M412B	4	Feature PAcked-Great Camera The camera is very good. Wide Angle, Telephoto and help maximize pixel usage... The reversed selfie image correction is confusing -actually take a reversed image Instructions not clear. That said the picture quality is very good -OK not as good as my Nikon SLR but for a Cellphone excellent and the response time taking a picture is excellent. Bixby-left it turned off as best it would allow..Honestly too confusing and intrusive...Reviews share that view. Battery life is excellent after a typical day of 16+ hours 85-90% is not unusual. Rapid charging works great.... Speaker is clear and reasonable fidelity. Speakerphone OK ... And it seems to be durable....The screen clarity in sun is good and the resolution is excellent.. One issue - gripping it with your fingers rolling over the edge of the body can confuse the touch screen. Don't overlap the edges of the screen... LAst but not least -once I confirmed the frequencies and channels of operation (took a bit of time) It is a Worldwide Cellphone covering virtually all the International Cell Frequencies and Channels Overall - an excellent cell phone... 1;	0.4	9.8
B07N4M412B	4	Great Phone So Far, but bad packing Overall I really like the phone so far. This was a switch from the S6. It really is not much bigger than the S6, though I would like it a little smaller. Looking forward to discovering the new features. The shipping of the item on the other hand... I live overseas and ordered this phone because it is unlocked and I want to use it here and in the States. Typically I experience items that are overprotected with form or shipping air bubbles, but this was in a box with other items and had zero protective packing. The primary box arrived to the post office damaged. The other items in the box were fine and not in need of special packing. The phone was in the box and in a sealed plastic bag. I opened the bag and it appeared the phone had been moved slightly. I did not want to hassle with a replacement because the device appears to have no issues and I was not sure if I would have any better luck with a replacement. The replacement process was also a hassle, in that I was required to pay for the shipping. We will see if I encounter any issues in the coming weeks. 1;	0.0	4.7
B07N4M412B	4	Mostly awesome Loved the color and storage space. But the s10e was too small for me to be comfortable with it. For that much money I want something bigger. (Yes I did read the dimensions before ordering bit hoped that it would work anyway, ended up returning it) size was my only negative comment about this phone. 1;	0.1	2.1
B07N4M412B	4	Came with a scratch unfortunately. I love the phone. It's been a day since opening. BUT i'm sad there was a scratch on the screen. I mean its not major and you dont see it while using the device but i notice it and it bothers me especially after buying this myself. I'm really upset about it. You can mostly see it when its off and My screen protecter didnt even come yet but its like whats the point if the screen is scratched. My Galaxy S8 never had any scratches... 1;	0.0	3.2

B07N4M412B	4	I needed a phone and this not live up to what I expected. Certainly not deserving of media hype I was disappointed in this screen, because my Samsung tab S3 has a Super AMOLED screen and it is far superior than this Dynamic AMOLED and which surprises me because that's a few years apart in Technology. Samsung seems to be going backwards. What I did like is the 8 gigs of RAM, Which is far better than the phone it replaced which was a Note Edge with only 3 gigs and the new processor Just Smokes compared to my old phone. I too was hoping for a better camera and it surprises me because Samsung actually developed a phone camera sensors that is three times bigger and have have sold them to the competition which they are using. I understand they are using the same sensors that was on the Samsung S7. Samsung is cutting corners but certainly not the price. I am glad I upgraded, but I wish Samsung would be more proactive in utilizing the technology they have been developing. In my opinion Samsung should have had the best camera of anyone but that is not the case with the S10 series. I'm wondering if they're holding out till S11 series. A brighter more vivid screen as my tab S3 would also be welcome. 1;	0.1	3.9
B07N4M412B	4	Got this as a Prime Day Deal. Good buy I picked this up as a Prime Day Deal. Otherwise I would not have bought this as my old S7 was still doing the job (though it's battery was on the dying, sucky end). Samsung is hands down the best of all the smartphones. And I say this as a 25 year IT admin who has been through every phone out there since they first came out with Blackberries, Iphones and Droids. The only possible misgiving I have is not optiing for the bigger, better Galaxy Note 5? But, from what I recall they were not offering that on the Prime Day deal. The only reason I say this, is after going to the Verizon store and seeing the Note, I think it's a nicer, bigger and cooler phone for me to use for work. Otherwise this S10e is much like my beloved S7...except with a bit more screen space ;) 1;	0.2	4.3
B07N4M412B	4	Expected better camera quality. I've used multiple samsung and sony phones in the past. Samsung always beat sony phones in terms of camera quality but i was a bit disappointed with the quality of the S10+ with the Xperia 1. I am expecting Samsung to be far ahead of Sony on the camera department but this one shocks me. Just look at the same pic, i was able to get more details on the Sony Xperia 1 and the image of the S10+ is a bit warm. I hope Samsung can further improve their cameras on the Note 10. 1;	-0.1	1.4
B07N4M412B	4	pretty good phone Switched over from my last phone without much drama. pictures, texts, email....all good. The only issue I seem to be having is phone calls. I don't receive all my phone calls. I suppose it's possible the service in my area changed, but if so, it happened right when I switched over to my S10e. I do love the size ...fits right in my pocket. :) 1;	0.2	4.4
B07N91S9MW	4	Good phone for the price Get it for $259.99 on sale. The phone is rock solid when I receive it. Enough for everyday task and all but when I tried demanding game aka pubg mobile or NBA 2k it can only run smoothly at low setting (seems like the specs of this phone is detected to run on low setting by the apps even though it can probably run at medium). Everything seems solid after two days using. The finger print is sensitive to the point whenever I touched it it automatically unlock the phone 😀. I do need to charge once a day with heavy usage. so I disable unnessesary notification. Fast and reliable connection on both cellular TMobile lte and wifi. Unfortunately it does not have AC wifi thou so my speed is locked at ~ 170 Mbps. Overally great phone for the price. 1;	0.2	4.4

B07N9M9FX4	4	Good but fragile This is a nice phone however it is very fragile. If you drop the phone from a sitting position it will shatter the glass that surrounds it.

B07NNVLH1D	4	Good phone for the Money. So far this seems to be a pretty good phone for the money. There are a lot more pros than there are cons. I love the size and clarity of the screen. It was very easy to activate on Metro and works great. The camera is very sharp and takes great pictures and I love the wide angle lens. The one major Con for me is the fingerprint scanner. Most of the time it does not recognize my finger print and I have to revert to using my pin. I have registered multiple finger prints and none of them will unlock the phone. I have been using this phone for almost a week and the battery hold up very well. I am not on my phone all day, but I do use it quite a lot during the day for both business and personal use. At the end of the day I generally have a little of 50% of my battery left. I would recommend this phone to anyone that doesn't want to spend $500 to $1000 dollars on a cell phone. 1;	0.2	6.5
B07NNVLH1D	4	Great choice in replacement phone I like that this is a Samsung. It came with a clear rubber style case which allows for the color with the prismatic Glastic to show through. The keyboard for messaging is a little slow to respond. However, I personally didn't want to pay 1K for a phone...so this is acceptable to me. It's pretty much plug and play. I am using on the Cricket network. It does come with an SD card..which is an amazing value. If you are looking for a replacement phone, without paying full retail for a flagship...Go for it! 1;	0.4	3.9
B07NNVLH1D	4	Great phone for its price. I have nothing to tell about the phone because the phone itself was very good. It's just about the packaging of this product. I gave 4 stars because the box of the phone itself (not the amazon box) was not sealed. It comes with the sticker which says there's a 64gb sd card inside. If the box was sealed at first, I could have given 5 stars. 1;	0.3	2.6
B07NP3RD5H	4	All around it is a great phone. I had to return it for one reason. Because this phone is international, it does not work with Verizon. The phone its self is pretty impressive though. It doesn't have the best camera but it definitely works well. Other than that, I experienced no problems. I will be buying a non-international version that works with Verizon soon. 1;	0.4	3.9
B07NP3RD5H	4	Satisfied. Big screen, good battery life, good performance, excellent connectivity, Android not cluttered with too much useless software. The only con is the lack of NFC. This is not a big deal to me right now, but it could be as digital payment systems become for common. 1;	0.2	1.8

B07NP3RD5H	4	Pretty solid phone for the price! I have T-Mobile and got this phone to replace a Moto G5 that fell into some water. I live in the States and was hesitant about picking this one up, but it worked like a charm and I didn't even have to visit the T-Mobile store - just swap the SIM card out and boot it up. Pros: -Fast phone -Fast charge -Large screen -Good camera -Decent charge Cons: -Fingerprint scanner is iffy -Heavy usage will drain the phone in about 3 hours from full charge (like playing an ARG) -Speaker doesn't give the best audio quality Overall, for how I use a phone, it's a great buy! 1;	0.3	2.5
B07NPRQYP1	4	Automatic screen light changes and the phone is made in China My experience with this phone is that the delivery was made on time, when I started reading the manual I noticed something curious and it is that the manual is in Spanish which is perfect for me because my native language is Spanish, reading the manual at the end I could read that this phone was made in China and the charger says the same. When I started using it, I was worried because the battery did not last long, and the light on the screen changed constantly and bothered me. After investigating a little more about this phone I could realize that the battery does not last long because of the inactivity mode image that makes the phone screen turn on in constant periods of time, which I managed to deactivate in phone configuration. On the other hand the change of lights that the phone's screen has while you use it is due to a sensor that has to make the light of the phone's screen adjust automatically, it can be deactivated in the Motorola application that brings it installed on the telephone. To finish I want to say that the phone works perfectly, it is fast, the service I am using is T-Mobile, the quality of the camera is good for the price. This phone was what I needed. 1;	0.0	3.7
B07NPRQYP1	4	Good value; just no specific Cellular 5GHz WiFi Great price, good phone. Just make sure you understand it will not run 5GHz wireless, period, on either WiFi or Cellular.

B07NPRQYP1	4	Be Aware... Seems like a screaming deal-love it so far. BUT, be aware this does NOT use the standard Micro USB.

B07NPRQYP1	4	exceptional battery life, a bit sluggish when multitasking Delivery made it to NZ super quick Most days I use this phone constantly for a good 12/13 hours per day when I'm out of town on business and I don't have access to charging - it doesnt get hot, and the battery doesn't drop below 30% - I'm amazed. It seems to need rebooting at least once per week, and gets a bit slow when I'm multitasking. All in all - impressed with features! 1;	0.5	2.1
B07NPRQYP1	4	Amazing battery life!!!, muffled calls and pour call volume. Worth it. Calls are muffled (I believe the placement of the microphone might have something to do with this, being at the bottom and the phone being as long as it is) and call volume max is too low. The screen can get warm at times. The battery life is definitely one of the best things about this phone. 1;	0.2	3.3
B07NPRQYP1	4	A good phone for the price So far I'm liking this phone, compared to the zte I had before. What I like mostly is the battery life, seems like I could stream and talk forever.

The increase in storage is worth it if you’re able to get coverage. In mid Florida, I’m getting decent lte coverage. I saw it go to 3g at one point but my call was clear and did not drop.

B07NZX5BKH	4	Almost the Perfect Phone - Missing the Samsung Radio App My niece and I love this phone (we both have one) we have been using it for about three weeks now and it is amazing. There is one thing that I do not like with this phone and that is the absence of the Samsung radio app. I upgraded from the Samsung A8 Plus and prior to that I had an S4 Mini. Both were international unlocked phones and both came with the regular AM/FM radio app (uses the headphones as the antena). I was surprised to find that the version of the S10 Plus that I have - Exynos version - does not come with this type of radio installed. I personally do not like the internet radio apps or at least would have preferred to have the chance to choose. Another gripe I have is the fact that although this phone is a dual sims phone, you have to choose between the extra sim card or your SD card. The A8 Plus had two dedicated sim card slots and the SD card slot. Lastly a very minor gripe is the reduced length of the USB-C cable. The S10 Plus it is 38 inches while the one for my old Samsung A8 Plus it is 46 or 48 inches. 1;	0.0	4.3

B07P6Y7954	4	Very Convenient, no scratches, finger prints, or scratches! No scratches no finger prints no cracks on the screen! The iphone XR is great for most purposes, social media, games, and streaming videos, which makes it very convenient. It does indeed have a 1080p resolution screen. After getting to level 19 in hole.io the amount of objects loading and your hole’s size started were what I believe started the temperature of the phone to raise. Battery life is very useful, it can last the whole time your awake (7-14hours) on 50% brightness. In fact, i’m using it right now to write this review.

B07P6Y8L3F	4	Very Convenient, no scratches, finger prints, or scratches! No scratches no finger prints no cracks on the screen! The iphone XR is great for most purposes, social media, games, and streaming videos, which makes it very convenient. It does indeed have a 1080p resolution screen. After getting to level 19 in hole.io the amount of objects loading and your hole’s size started were what I believe started the temperature of the phone to raise. Battery life is very useful, it can last the whole time your awake (7-14hours) on 50% brightness. In fact, i’m using it right now to write this review.

B07PPZQHPV	4	Sound quality Just to start off. I manly bought this phone for the MP3 sound quality. Ever since Sony came out with the Walkman,I liked the idea of having a walking music collection. So now it has been added to the phone's,I can have crazy music collection. To me Sony have the best and I do mean the BEST! sound quality. Sure there are others that are a little louder but do not have: Clear Audio+,Sound effects,Equalizer or Surround sound(VPT). I use my Sony Xperia 10+ plus when I go to or on a picnic with my 2 UE Mega Boom and 2 UE Boom speakers. And BOY and GIRLS this thing ROCKS!! Ok, now the camera is good for me. The display in the sun is not the best but for me it's workable. I also choose the No Warranty in The USA - GSM ONLY, NO CDMA model cause I'm a senior citizen and retired so I use the free government phone service. With the GSM model I'm able to use my phone with the SIMM card without having to have it programmed to the phone. So if the breaks I can take the SIMM out and put it in another GSM model phone. Also with this model it has 2 SIMM slots so if I want a extra number all I have to do is insert another GSM SIMM. The only other small draw back I have with this phone is the width. I wish it was a little wider. Outside of that,for me this phone is great. When I play my music with the UE Boom speakers I can get 5 hours of battery life,then I start to limit on how much or how I use the phone until I recharge it. 1;	0.2	8.6
B07PV68K73	4	Great phone but weird fingerprint reader and the face recognition kinda sucks? Frankly it's a GOOD phone. Better than I expected. Photo qualities are vibrant and lovely, the phone calls are clear, GPS is lovely. HOWEVER. There is a problem. The fingerprint reader is REALLY finicky as is the Facial Recognition thing. They feel rather gimicky compared to having a proper scanner on the back plate but otherwise, it is a handsome phone and looks and feels wonderful. The notch is a teardrop style and doesn't give me much hassel but I don't really care for that. Just be aware that the biometric security is more gimicky than others. 1;	0.2	4.9

B07PY52GVP	4	The charger never work i need to buy other one I give 4 stars because the touch screen is extremely sensitive and sometimes it just clicks with the finger but without touching it. That scares me because on one occasion I was in amazon and I put my finger (without touching the screen) and clicked on buying an item when I did not touch it! The excellent battery has lasted me up to a full day with heavy use watching series and talking on the phone all day. Even in a moderate one without videos lasts 2 days. I hate the charger, it never worked and the cable did the same. I had to buy others because in amazon they told me they can not make the seller send only that damaged piece. 1;	-0.1	2.9

I had to use my LG adapter since they didn't have the US region adapters. All in all, would recommend for any light users out there with just the main specs. 1;	0.4	3.7

B07PY52GVP	4	No More Samsung For Me! This phone is really incredible for the money, and it puts Apple and Samsung to shame. It absolutely holds it's own against more expensive phones. The biggest thing you are going to be losing is the software. The software consists of the necessary and basic features of an Android phone. There aren't many of the special features that Samsung offers in their phones. For me this is actually another bonus. I didn't have to go through the settings for 30 minutes turning off features that I was never going to use. It's just a simple usable phone with great hardware and an eye-pleasing 6.3 inch display. There are two reasons that this phone does not get 5 starts. The first being that the back is made of glass. It is a well built phone but there is no reason that any phone should have a glass back. All this does is weaken the structure of the phone and make it considerably slippery (increasing the chance of drops and breaks). My last phone has a glass back and it was the only phone I ever broke because of it. In Xiaomi's defense, the phone does come with a free case to protect it and I really appreciate that. The second reason is the Mi UI. It's very basic. So much so, that it seems to lack some things. For example, I haven't quite figured out how to do a group text with the Mi texting app. After some research it seems like it might not even be possible, which is a little frustrating. Bottom line: If you are thinking about this phone because your current one is busted or you want a good upgrade for a great value, then just buy it. 1;	0.0	8.2

B07Q6ZZ4S1	4	Amazing phone!!! Except... Had issues receiving texts when I first got the phone(didn't receive any at all) and incoming, and at times outgoing, calls were spotty at times, but after replacing the SIM card, waiting a day to see if it would work, and doing a hard factory reset, I am finally receiving texts. There's a catch though; if I change the phone's theme, it stops working and I have to restart the phone to fix the text issue again. Phone calls are also seeming to come in without an issue as well (though this issue had improved prior to the SIM card replacement). Aside from this snag, the phone is great! The camera is a dream come true, crisp display, and runs smoothly. If it weren't for the strange text/theme quirk, I'd rate it 5 stars. Additional information: I'm a Metro PCS customer located in South Florida. As far as bands go, it doesn't seem to leave band 4. In regards to speed, it falls short of 4 LG but it's still faster than 3 LG. 1;	0.1	5.3

B07Q84DPZH	4	2GB Ram; Major Lag issues This phone is great for the money. After my father broke his phone, I bought him this phone as a form of upgrade from his ancient Note 4.

I cannot really complain due to the fact that it does have 2 GB ram and i knew that well before i even purchased the phone. Great phone though! Props to Samsung. 1;	0.2	2.7

B07Q84DPZH	4	Decent base phone It is a Samsung but it is nothing like their flagship. It is cheap, does its job and overall I am happy to see that it works better than a used S8 or even S9, but cost half the price. Large memory, can be expanded with SD cards; the phone call quality is good; and internet is good too, as long as you have a decent signal (using T-mobile). The screen is bright and does its job. The only downside is that it is quite slow in some occasion; compared to an iPhone 8 or an S9 for example, but it is only when you put too many apps on screen at the same time. Memory and CPU are low tier, so that is expected. Battery life is horrible; did go through 3 charge cycle and after 8 hours doing nothing, the battery was already in red. Not sure if my phone is defective or what. Also I am not sure if the phone is new or refurb; got it in the original packaging but it did look like it was used. Was sold as new and overall the packaging did look like new; but something did look off; at least considering the packaging for S9 and S10. The camera takes decent pictures; it is a simple 13MP, but does its job. Won't get any National Geographic worthy shots, but for kids and random stuff it is more than enough. 1;	0.1	7.0

Occasionally, I might have to do some multi-app processing, but my use is usually just web browsing, equipment-specific control apps, and the usual phone stuff. That being said, I really like this phone. I like it more than the S10+. The fingerprint reader on the S10+ can be maddening and is often unusable. It also takes longer to unlock the phone. The one on the A20 has been nothing but reliable, and is so much faster to unlock the phone. For normal use, the difference between the two is not even noticable. Once again, I don't game. The drawbacks are the screen resolution, and the video output and screen casting. The screen resolution of the A20 is not nearly as good, so fine detail is out the window. I do have to zoom pages to read small print on occasion. I have yet to get the A20 to put video out of the USB-C with an adapter. The S10+ works like a champ with an adapter.

B07QV2JKGQ	4	Great budget phone for the price Okay so let's get down to the brass tax and get straight to the point. For a budget phone this is an awesome phone but honestly Samsung is rolling their A series with a slight screen defect. Now I know there is an obvious firmware issue with most of them and it can be a simple fix but for free starting holding the power down and volume down rocker button and making sure that you have plenty of charge on your battery so you can revive your supposed black screen problem. I am sure most of the time that's all the issue is in my case I was the one unlucky individual who received one brand new out of the package device that worked perfectly for 24 hours then failed having a black screen of death that could not be resolved through this simple restart. I'm not saying this is not a good phone because it is you just have to be mindful that if you are one of those individuals who receive one and it doesn't work you might get lucky knowing that it might just be the firmware issue, if not then you're the very unlucky one and it gets a defective screen where there's nothing you can do other than send it back hoping for a good replacement A series phone. Don't let my review stop you from buying one Samsung is a really good brand and you have to remember they're pushing out phones quicker than we can count so something's bound to go wrong somewhere and Amazon in my opinion is your greatest option when buying a new phone as long as its under prime protection so that if you are the unlucky and unfortunate individual Amazon has your back. So with that said the only thing you have to worry about it's possibly getting one that rolls out the bad screen otherwise I would have submitted a 5-star review. I hope this review helps you find what you were looking for. 1;	0.0	4.4

B07QZSD327	4	A Great Everyday Phone Bought this phone for use on AT&T. Works without issue. Fingerprint reader is quick, face recognition works well - even in low light settings. Phone has handled everything I've thrown at it. Is it as fast as some of the flagship phones from LG or Samsung that run newer Snapdragon processors - No, it's not. Does it fit the bill for everyday use and some moderate gaming - it sure does. The screen is huge and takes some getting used to for one-hand operation. My only complaint, is that even though it states the screen is Gorilla Glass, mine scratched fairly easily in my pocket from loose change and keys. I was pretty upset by that, but bought some 4H glass screen protectors which has helped, but still have the visible scratches. Overall, an excellent choice in phones. Save yourself from spending $30+ per month leasing your phone from your wireless carrier and buy an unlocked phone. This phone has definitely suited my needs and now my son has one and my wife has the A50. For US customers, be sure to get the A305G variant as it has more of the LTE bands used in the United States for almost every carrier. 1;	0.4	7.7

B07RS512XL	4	"A70, the mid-range king! \This phone is absolutely amazing. I've had it for a few months (about four) and I've only come across a few hiccups when compared to flagship $800-$1,099 phones. The only one being that the advertised 128 GB is expandable memory and it keeps giving me the message that it is \""\""unsupported\""\"". I don't mind much because I haven't been using it ever since I got the phone. Pros: -PRICE -Cameras -HUGE screen -Beautiful back colors -Face recognition is super fast -Has in screen fingerprint reader -Feels just like any other huge phone CONS -Fingerprint reader is a bit slow -Reigon locked device (no Samsung pay and such) -may be a bit too big for some hands -video quality craps out later at night (might just be my phone) Overall I've used this phone over a good amount of time and I love it  a great budget friendly phone AND everyone asks if it's the note 10 😂\"";"""	0.4	2.7
B07RS512XL	4	Amazing phone for the price Fast performance. Lots of storage. Huge, bright screen. Headphone jack and memory card slot. Newer version of Android. Only reason that I took off a star is for the in-screen fingerprint reader. Sometimes it's slow or doesn't work, and can be faster to just use a PIN code to unlock. Everything else though, awesome phone and build quality for the price. 1;	0.4	3.9
B07RS512XL	4	Good phone with sketchy fingerprint reader Only dislike...not waterproof/resistant and finger print reader misses the mark 1/5 of the time used with the same thumb registered 3 times and with the new update but amazing value for sure.

B07RS512XL	4	Winner from Samsung The A70 is an excellent device. I hope in display fingerprint sensors are only a fad. The issue is my XL fingers, most time it fails because my finger is not in the right spot. But the face unlock, WOW, works ever time, except when it's very dark! One FYI for users: Setting up emails. If you have sub-folders you have to press the folder icon to the left, not the name of the parent folder. This only works in he lower All Folders tree. Few silly issues, like I cant use an mp3 for notification tone or have multiple DND profiles, but the Samsung Sound Assistant app comes to the rescue in the latter. Overall happy with the purchase, happy with the A70. Extremely excited with the bonus, free 128 GB SD card! 1;	0.1	4.7

B07VD3JH2C	4	Switched from Samsung First time trying to buy a phone from Amazon. I had a Samsung S7 edge beforehand. Using this with Google fi. Pros: price, battery life last for 2 days, fast OS, Android one is amazing, camera quality has potential Cons: camera is slow meaning motion blur is extremely sensitive and it also has a delay on capture. I've attached some pictures I've taken. I have extremely steady hands but there is still some blur in the picture of the flower. Bluetooth connection is spotty - it works but there is often interference. AUX output is lower compared to my Samsung and I don't know how to fix this. I had to exchange my first one for another because it had some video issues (blue bands on the image). It was performing slower than reported and had SD card issues. This new one doesn't have the same problems. I've attached pictures of the difference in speed. I've had this model for a couple weeks and it is getting just a bit slower according to the speed test app I use but I haven't noticed a change in use. Will update if anything changes. 1;	-0.1	4.3

B004GLQTG8	5	"So far, really good! Amazing bargain at $10 \This is my third Net10 phone. First two were AT&T phones, lots not to like about AT&T in southwest CT (IMHO), so I made sure this is Verizon, and it is! (G at the end of the name indicates AT&T, C means Verizon.) Most important functionality for me is good coverage (Verizon), good voice commands (reliable Bluetooth) and decent texting ability (not bad on this device). My first phone (Samsung T401G) was a slider, which really does beat the fakeBerry style phone for texting, but the phone had no voice dialing, so Bluetooth was not fully functional. Scratch that. My second phone was a Samsung R455G (AT&T). It looked much like this phone and was actually heftier, nicer casing, a kind of mini-track pad for moving the cursor. It looked more like the $40 I paid rather than this $10 phone. BUT, the Bluetooth was the weirdest I've ever encountered (I wrote a review on Amazon), and any time you hit the space bar when texting, you were equally likely to get a period. So you. Would get. Sentences. Like this. Scratch that. So, with the R355C I get Verizon connectivity, a NORMAL fully-functional Bluetooth, and the ability to text relatively easily. I actually find typing on the fakeBerry much easier than I would have thought. The worst is all the overlays (for punctuation and things like $ / etc.), which, if you have started losing your fine eyesight as I have, is murder, because it's very hard to see what's on each key. I suppose over the life of the phone I will get used to the most common things I use, but while the phone is new it's a bit of a drag. Not the phone's fault. Unlike some phones with exposed buttons (like the R455G), this phone does not lock itself every time it goes dark, which is a feature I actually like. You can easily lock it (hold the space bar) before putting it in your purse, but if it's sitting on your desk, it doesn't lock up every time it goes dormant, which is great if you're in the midst of a somewhat sporadic text exchange. Somewhat unusually, to unlock the phone you press a soft key and the space bar rather than the center or \""\""ok\""\"" button  which seems the more common configuration. Haven't had it long enough to comment on battery life;"""	0.0	8.5
B004GLQTG8	5	"CDMA New Hampshire for US Cellular people. \Works great in New Hampshire. It uses the US Cellular towers (CDMA). Would recommend! Just as a hint: the \""\""C\""\"" in R355C stands for CDMA which is what Verizon and US Cellular uses. ATT uses GSM if the phone ends in \""\""G\""\"" then it won't be compatible with CDMA towers (Verizon and US Cellular)\"" 1;"""	0.1	1.8

B004H23JXW	5	Really impressed with the phone and Windows 7.5 I ordered the Samsung Focus I917 unlocked phone because the price was good and I wanted to test out Windows 7 OS. My carrier is Consumer Cellular and a 2nd sim card from them was free plus adding the phone to my account is just 10 dollars a month. I received the card and phone on the same day, inserted the card and voila, I was making calls. Before doing that I inserted a 32 gig microSD card so now I have a ton of memory to work with. Setting up wireless with my home network was a snap and using the USB connection to download the updates and apps I want was easy (GPS, Google stuff, etc.). I had to download those things because the phone is pre-loaded with AT&T proprietary apps and no AT&T account, no working apps. The nicest surprise I got was that Windows office is preloaded. I had to set up Skydrive on my both my home PC and the phone but now I can download and edit documents (word, excel, powerpoint) whenever I like. What wasn't nice was that cellular data connection wasn't working. At first I was blaming it on the phone not being unlocked but that wasn't the case, a call to Consumer Cellular support and 5 minutes later I was using my cellular data connection to the web. So, bottom line: its not going to be perfectly set up out of the box and may require working with your carrier service but once its set up, its great. If you have to consult with your cellular carrier you'll need your IMEI number. It'll speed things up if you already have it and you can get it by dialing *#06# on your phone and writing down the number for their use. Oh, you need to install ZUNE onto your PC, I'm not particularly impressed with it but its no big deal, I only use it to sync music anyway. 1;	0.0	6.1
B004H23JXW	5	"First time unlocked buyer \This was my first time buying a 'unlocked' phone on amazon so I was a bit worried. I read that it can use any provider as long as it has a sim card. I use a provider that is local based only so I was somewhat hesitant, but it works like it said it would. It came when the delivery said it would and I've been fiddling and adding contacts so far. I like how fast it is and it definitely doesn't seem like a 'older' smartphone. It's very sensitive, which I had to get used too. It also doesn't seem like it can break easy and isn't really flimsy. I like the design of it, but I'm a bit disappointed that I can't use the AT&T GPS without signing a 10 dollar a month free. That's not really that big of a deal as there's a built in app called \""\""Maps' That does basically the same. It finds your locations very quickly and is basically like a map quest. The Wifi works perfectly as well and it's pretty fast. Overall I'm pleasantly surprised and would buy another unlocked phone on here!

B00727AODC	5	Good phone, meh! Operating system. Purchased this phone for my sister as a replacement for her Samsung Focus SGH-i917 which just stopped working and would not power on (despite having a new battery etc.). Later found that this has been a problem Samsung Focus owners had been having. Because she had loved that phone and was used to the operating system, we selected this particular model and she loves it. It is pretty good looking and the screen is nice and vibrant. The colors are very vivid and everything appears very clearly on it from videos to text. The build quality is very good and although the body is made of a plastic material it feels very sturdy. It is not as 'bulky' or as heavy as the other focus, and it fits very nicely in the hand. The phone is quite fast and seems to run all of the apps currently installed smoothly and without issue. The camera is also pretty good, though not as good as the aforementioned model of the Focus. Internet connectivity on wifi and through data plan is fast enough for her purposes. Battery life is also not too bad and is able to last the whole day, 7 am - 5 pm, with wifi and data internet connectivity turned off. The only issue she is having is with some of the limits it has. For example; there arent as many apps in the app store, and a vast majority of them look weird or are not as optimized or refined as those for other Mobile O.S's. She is constantly complaining about the facebook app. Another thing is the fact that it cannot connect to other bluetooth devices for some reason. I read somewhere that it can only connect to other windows phones. All in all she is happy with it so I'm giving it a full 5 Stars. 1;	0.2	11.3
B00727AODC	5	Estoy muy feliz con mi compra El producto lo compre con muchas expectativas, mi objetivo era un celular no muy caro, que funcionara en Colombia, con un aspecto que pudiese compararse con un celular de una gama alta, con buenas características y creo que cumplió con esas expectativas al 100%, lo único malo es que la calidad de las llamadas no es muy buena, y algunas aplicaciones como whatsapp tienen muchos problemas en windows phone.

B007X6FFLS	5	The Samsung a157 Gophone I ordered this being I never use a cell... seldon need one but my landline needs a new box so being it was going to take over a week to fix I ordered the phone. It's simple to use.. unlike the smartphone. I believe it's great for ones who don't need the extra details that smarphones carry. It has many features like texting, net and calender... not sure of what it all has. The sim card that comes with it doen't work to let you send or recieve calls, you need to go to the AT&T store for the sim card for the number you will get (only for new cell phone users) The cost was 25.00... or if you have a sim card from another phone that can be used. Wanted one that would close ... that was another plus for I never carry a purse. It has an easy to carry plug-in or recharging... another plus... I ordered another phone and it came but the keys are too small as is the text... it's more like an I-phone... wished I had kept this one. 1;	0.1	4.9

B007X6FFLS	5	For the price (cheap!) - it's great! Keeping in mind that this phone is REALLY CHEAP and there's no contract, it's great. Absolutely no frills, but at least it runs on 3G for enhanced nationwide coverage and uses microUSB for charging which all modern devices use. I activated one of these for my uncle. He doesn't want a camera, he doesn't take it with him all the time, and it will be used sparingly. I set it up on the $25 every 90 days auto pay plan and it's 10 cents a minute. That's 250 minutes every 90 days which is way more than he'll ever use, plus it all carries over. The auto pay adds minutes 2 days before the expiration date so you never have to worry. That's less than $10 a month, tax included.. Can you say.. Bargain? This phone does not have an external caller ID display - so you'll have to flip it open first to see who is calling - but if you're like my uncle, it's mainly for him to call out so he really could care less. 1;	0.0	3.6

B008P2SUEI	5	My Dad Loves It! Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my father who only needs a phone for calls and voicemails. No contracts, no texts, no gaming, no internet, you get the idea. He really likes the sturdy, flip design, date/time display on the outside of the phone and the color screen with large font. He says the battery lasts a long time in between charges and that conversations come in loud and clear on both ends. If you are looking for a basic, no frills phone, I don't think you can go wrong with this one! 1;	0.2	2.4

B0096QYH80	5	I really love this phone, just hate Verizon.... I bought this, and it was in great condition. Although it was not new, it was in near perfect condition. The phone worked great while on Verizon, and I LOVED it due to the size and the battery life was phenomenal too. I really cannot say enough about this phone. Since then I have switched providers and now cannot use this phone. I just wish I could use it on another carrier. I wish they made one that was compatible with T-Mobile or AT&T. Sadly, not so. I had to purchase something sort of close (but much bigger, uggghhh). I do have to say that I had one issue with this phone's battery while on a flight. I did get on a plane and put the phone to Airplane mode after we took off. After we got to cruising altitude, I noticed the phone (which was in my pocket) got VERY HOT... So hot that I was afraid that it would explode even! I took it out of my pocket, but was unable to power it down. Eventually the short caused the battery to completely discharge, so it cooled down. So I arrived without a functional phone to call my ride... not so good, but I connected it to a charger--the charge took, and I was able to call. The battery never did that again, and it worked just fine after that. Not sure what caused this, but I was a little scary! 1;	0.0	8.1
B0096QYH80	5	Easy to use, attractive, and zippy I've had this phone for about two months now and I have been very happy with it so far. I'm no techno expert so I can't talk about processing speed and all that jazz. I can say that I have barely noticed any lag at all going from application to application, the internet speed is fast, and the google voice search function is very impressive. I enjoy the interface of the phone (the three circle thing on the home screen is useful) and I found it easy to learn how to get around. It also has a cool feature whose official name I don't know. Basically it's a tiny notification light that flashes on the top left of the face of the phone. It changes color based on if you have a message/what type of message it is. I find this handy because you can tell if you have a new message without turning on the screen. One thing I miss about my old phone (continuum) is the ticker bar along the bottom that showed a preview of the actual message or phone call you had received without turning on the main screen, but oh well. Overall I'm very happy with this phone, especially for the amazing price of .01! 1;	0.5	7.5
B0096QYH80	5	"Speedy Little Phone \I upgraded from a Droid Charge, so this phone is quite an advancement for me. I love running an updated version of Android for a change. I also love the dual core processor. It is smooth. I haven't encountered any lag as of yet running any app. The 8GB of internal RAM doesn't seem to be an issue for me. I don't have a ton of stuff to put on the phone, and even if I did I have a 32GB SD card for media, so 8GB is plenty of internal storage. The battery life in this thing is phenomenal. I haven't felt a pressing need to charge the phone at all yet because it survives all day until bed time with ample power left every day. I plug my phone in every night as a matter of habit from my old phones. I don't think this phone needs it though. I leave 4G data on all day. I also have rules setup to enable WiFi when I'm home. The rules are especially nice and handy for controlling the phone without actively having to change settings, which is something I had to often on my Droid Charge. I especially appreciate the smaller form factor of this phone. My Charge had a 4.3\""\"" screen  as does this phone;"""	0.3	7.9

B009ZC91AY	5	Major upgrade from the iPhone 3GS that I had This is a truly awesome phone. Since my iPhone 3GS can't upgrade to iOS7,I figured it was a time for an upgrade. I considered long and hard before choosing a Windows Phone and I am glad that I did Sure, some apps I was used to having are not yet available, but I find the Windows Phone experience truly superior and this phone is a real gem. The size is just right, even with a nice leather case. It is fast, and fun to use. It paired perfectly with my car and other Bluetooth devices and has met and exceeded my every expectation. Since I generally charge every day, the battery life is perfectly acceptable for my needs. I am very glad that I chose this over an iPhone 5. 1;	0.4	5.2

B009ZC91AY	5	This smartphone is awesome I love this Phone, I came from Android and used a lot of brand my last phone was the HTC ONE X. I don't like IOS too much so i decided to give Windows Phone a try and it was so much better than i spected. The Nokia Lumia 920 is really fast for all the task. I play games like Aphalt 8, Six Guns, and they run so smooth. The OS make the things better you won't notice any lag on this phone not even on heavy duty. i liked it so much that i've just bought another one. Using WP 8.1 with preview for developers and the only thing that sucks is the battery life but is because the OS is still beta. 1;	0.4	4.6
B009ZC91AY	5	Nice phone at a reasonable price. I love this phone. My very slightly out of warranty iPhone went kaput and replacing it while still under ATT contract would have cost me a fortune.

Collecting my contacts and storing them in the new phone was painless. The wireless charging with the optional wireless charger is sweet! I come home after work and set my phone on the pad. In less than 30 minutes my phone is fully recharged. The price is right. There is a lot of bang for the buck with this phone. 1;	0.3	5.1

Received the phone promptly, beautiful little thing, that my daughter loved to play with. Windows applications for it may not be as plentiful as on Android, but they work surprisingly well. No issues. 6 months later the phone just hung. I have given CPR to Windows phones before, and saved two Nokia's that way (using Microsoft recommended recovery tool) but this time , it was not to be. I contacted the seller expecting a drawn out process, but was pleasantly surprised to receive a prompt response and a fair resolution. Highly recommend the product and the seller! 1;	0.5	7.6
B00ACZ0DUA	5	"Great Phone... Love Windows Phone, love windows phone on Lumia even more. \My Third Windows phone and my second Lumia. I went with the 920 even though it has been around for a while, because I wanted to buy a cheap non-contract phone(this one is locked to ATT) and not get tied to ridiculous monthly \""\""Next Plans\""\"" or extra fees for a two year contract renewal. The 920 has WP *8 and will support the 8.1 upgrade so i am waiting to install that. But I must say the job from WP7.8 (Lumia 900) to the 920 and WP8 is worth the price. Nokia Transfer My Data App was great for bringing over all my old SMS messages. Rest of Windows phone transfer is easy just sign into accounts and everything is there.

B00ACZ0DUA	5	Good LTE Phone with Solid Windows Features This is a very nice true 4G/LTE phone. Good grip, feels solid in my hand. Vivid yellow body with green screen background (a little variation from what's shown on the picture) makes the phone look very stylish.

B00B2BYU1Q	5	Lumia 920 Windows Phone is actually a great little smart phone. Easy to use. I have to admit that most people I talk to have never used, seen or attempted to understand a Windows Phone. Usually when I demo the phone, the response is one of surprise, how nice it looks and how easy it is to use. It's intuitive. I love how I can open my documents, whether they're Word, Excel, PowerPoint. I can use Skype for personal and business video calls and virtual meetings. It interacts with Facebook so all my contacts there automatically populate to the phone and it sets itself up. I can manage my email accounts (I have 3: business, personal and a 3rd party organization) easily from the home screen. My calendar is plainly visible from the home screen as well. When an appointment is coming up, the phone's personal assistant, Cortana, will automatically check road conditions and advise me when it's time to leave, if traffic conditions dictate. The apps are the only issue with this great phone, however I don't use that many apps. I can still research products, scan barcodes, listen to music, purchase music over the internet, view videos and much more. I love this phone and would like to see what improvements the upcoming Lumia 950 will have. 1;	0.3	8.7
B00B2BYU1Q	5	"Still a top tier Windows Phone I am not new to this phone, I had to get this one as a replacement for another 920 of mine that got stolen. First I am gonna just put my original device review here, then get into this particular posting. April 27, 2013: The phone's review will have to incorporate bits from the OS too, so let's be done with that first. Live Tile remains one of the best interface innovation on any platform, the addition of a smaller size of tile makes thing only better. Ability to change tile size of any app depending on user's priority is simply brilliant. Nokia Windows Phones come with access to Nokia's full suite of mapping apps, although they are now available to others also, Nokia stays on top of the game by providing other exclusive apps like Nokia Music, Cinematograph, Storage Manager etc. Offline mapping data is a godsend. Added capability of apps' to integrate to lock screen to quickly provide you with info you care about the most is also awesome. The added accessibility tools like changeable font size, UI zoom, high contrast mode(looks freaking gorgeous) makes the OS the best choice for people who needs any of them. The usual goodies are of course still there. Onto the device itself. The screen size is 4.5\  which in my opinion is the perfect size;"""	0.5	7.0
B00B2BYU1Q	5	It's the best cellphone I had. Period! It's beautiful, easy to use and so fast!. Microsoft do the best work with the OS and Nokia with the phone. Only two issues: First: At the time i received it in my country (Venezuela), four months later (thanks LibertyExpress), I need to Update the phone 5 times (3 updates for Windows Phone, two for Nokia - Lumia Amber and Black) to get the best experience. That was so easy. And second: It has the AT&T logo, but it's okay, it's unlocked. Finally, I have a Smartphone that covers all my mobile needs. I have a powerful camera (Perhaps no more powerful than the Lumia 1020) and now I have a very good reason to celebrate, since I came back to buy one of the Nokia's best masterpieces. 1;	0.6	6.1
B00B2BYU1Q	5	Very good phone with extra maps and fine looks My first smartphone in a long time.I really like it! :) Smooth, fast (apps could wake up from sleep faster IMO), good design. Looks cool. Works superb with WiFi networks. Good screen, not as good as AMOLED in Samsung Galaxy S2 for example but still clear and I can read fine print on any webpage I open. It can play YouTube videos smoothly. Default Internet Explorer browser works well so I didn't install any replacement. I little hard to quickly configure / update contacts. I do not know why it is so hard to add new phone number to contact... Especially those imported from LinkedIn. I definitely can recommend this phone for everyone who just want to call, send SMS, chat using Viber, Skype, surf network and make decent photos (because camerais not amazing, is good but definitely it could be better). Phone is a little heavy and not so think so you need to have proper size hand to hold it firmly. PS: Nokia maps and augoemnted reality apps are amazing but I can only see myself using those great maps and GPS navigation. 1;	0.4	7.8
B00B2BYU1Q	5	Excellent phone after updates. Summary: Overall a great phone. Excellent camera and overall responsiveness. I purchased this exclusively to function on Tracfone's Straight Talk network they promote from Walmart. Works perfectly after getting the SIM card installed and setting APN to Straight Talk's. I would have left this at 4 stars before the 8.1 update, however, with Windows Phone 8.1, Microsoft absolutely nailed the quality of life issues I had with the phone. Biggest culprit being integrated playlist creation and editing. Improvement to the lock and start screens also is a big plus. Only con I have right now is that the maps have some issues with GPS location in cities, tends to not get a signal. 1;	0.4	5.1

B00B2BYU1Q	5	Finally, my perfect phone! If you read somewhere that anyone who buys this phone customarily goes into a brain-gasm for five minutes of holding it - you read the truth. I did a whole lot of research and contemplation before making this purchase - and now I wish I had not spent that week without this beauty. The top contenders were iPhone 5, Galaxy S4, HTC 8X, HTC One and Lumia 920. I chose Lumia and here's why: Design: This is clearly the best selling point for the 920. Sure, iPhone 5 feels solid but Lumia with its premium (plastic?) and its weight feels as sturdy and nice. HTC 8X and One have sturdy bodies too - but somehow still feel cheap and smudge-prone. Galaxy S4 really loses the plot (for me) on design. It feels even more cheap and light and plastic than my old S2. I got the white one - against all taunts and persuasions from my girlfriend - but both of us now agree it does NOT look girly. Plus, its glossy look stays clear of fingerprints and dirt - and ends up looking more professional than the black. That's a big plus for me. I also like how the screen juts out of the white body by half a mm - feels great in the hand. I was a little worried about the waste of real estate towards the bottom bezel - but after using the phone - I barely notice it - and in fact like having that extra space for the home/back/search buttons. The weight is great - yes it does feel significantly heavier than any other phone out there - but you know what - it should feel like that - this is a substantial phone - and the weight also works to provide balance in hand. OS/Apps: Windows Phone OS is great - it's fluid beyond anything iOS or Android can offer and fortunately Microsoft is putting all its weight behind it. Everything works smooth, fast and looks like a million bucks. The Nokia-specific apps - Here Maps, Drive, Transit - are better than any other geo apps out there, period. I use public transit and nothing beats Here Transit. That been said, the Windows Phone store still lacks a lot of apps it shouldn't by now. There is no reliable Yellow Cab app, no Wells Fargo app, no decent Guitar tuner app in the store. But hopefully, as Windows Phone gets more popular - these shall follow. Oh and Nokia Music - so basically Nokia Music is like a Pandora service - which lets you listen to unlimited music mixes for free online but also allows you to download upto four such mixes for free for offline listening. Yes, you read this right. It IS that awesome. I use it everyday to the extent I no longer have any of my own music library on the phone. Other Features: The phone does not have FM. However it appears that the phone has always had the hardware for it - it just has been dormant. There is going to be a Lumia Amber update coming to the device very soon - which will enable FM. I could not ask for more. Wireless charging is a nice little feature - but I haven't personally used it. The camera looks great on specs - and almost everybody who has reviewed the phone has said the quality is fantastic - I haven't had a chance to really test the camera out. Nokia has of course brought out other Lumias after the 920 (925, 1020, 928). All of these offer the same set of features and quality (1020 of course gives you a 41 MP camera) - but if you want a phone that feels substantial in your hand or pocket and has a great finish overall - 920 is still the one to buy. 1;	0.2	18.3

B00B2BYU1Q	5	Great Phone Nokia simply makes the best phones. And the Windows OS, although not perfect, is fluid, colorful, crisp clean - the best of the three. The screen and photos are great.Its feel in the hand is smooth and sculptural - and just wonderful to look at. And probably the most important aspect: the clarity of calls. I highly recommend it - especially an unlocked version with a T-Mobile chip. The best combination. 1;	0.7	5.4

B00B2BYU1Q	5	LOVE LOVE LOVE. Goodbye iPhone My switch from apple to windows: Let me just say I have never really been a fan of the iPhone. It's just not my personal preference. I know there are plenty of people that like it, but not me...I was worried though switching from my iPhone to something where my app options were going to be completely foreign. Even if I love windows 8 for my desktop - I was hesitant about going to windows 8 mobile. I'm SO GLAD I made the change. Also, here is a novel idea. When I plug this thing into my computer via usb - guess what happens.....I CAN VIEW MY FILES AND MUSIC. I never wanted to resort to jailbreaking my iPhone because it permanently damaged my boyfriend's phone, and another friend we have had a heck of a time with his jailbreak. While this may be a problem that is generally few and far between - being as I was running my phone on a prepaid network and already had issues with that, I didn't want to jailbreak the phone. I shouldn't have to jailbreak a phone that is meant to play music in order to complete the generally simple task of loading music on the dang thing. The actual physical phone: I love the slim & sleek design, the very easy to use touch screen, the sensitivity adjustments for the touch screen, and the overall quality and feel. The screen size is perfect for my use. I was considering getting a tablet before I had this phone, and while this isn't exactly tablet-sized...I may actually skip the tablet for the time being. 1;	0.0	7.2
B00B2BYU1Q	5	Watch for the seller! Whenever buying phones on amazon, I watch out for sellers because some are just a ripoff. The two sellers I contacted were Mango Wireless and Heavyduty Electronics. They were both so kind in answering all my questions. I decided to go with Heavyduty Electronics because the one they sold was not an AT&T unlocked phone but it was a Movistar phone (Spanish Network) As for the phone itself, it came with a dead battery and took about 30 mins to get enough juices to get going (I was worried) but once it started it was all uphill from there. It's a great phone and I would recommend buying it from either Mango Wireless (AT&T unlocked) or Heavyduty Electronics (Movistar unlocked) I live in the Caribbean and it works just fine. I will update if necessary. Thanks Heavyduty Electronics! 1;	0.1	3.9
B00B2BYU1Q	5	Lumia 920 from Winda Great phone. Went from a Windows 6.9 phone to a Widows 7 and now this Windows 8. It is a RM-821 International Version. Some are AT&T Versions. I heard rumors that the AT&T Versions don't work well on T-Mobile. I didn't want to chance it so I got the RM-821. I received it and setup most of my stuff on Wifi. I also updated the system on Wifi. The next day I went to my local T-Mobile and picked up a micro-sim for the phone since my old phone had a full sized sim. Works very well. I get 4G and H+ in my area. So far so good. Love my Windows Phone! Tidbit: ZDNet had an article the other day about 150 of the fastest downloading phones. This phone came in 4th which is very good. 1;	0.2	5.6

The Nokia 920 is faster, the display is much much better, the battery performance is better, and the camera is out of this world. So what else is to be said about it. Great job Nokia. At first, I was concerned about the weigh of the phone, but it was nothing. The phone is perfect the way it is. It feel great in my hand. So far, I have no complain about the phone and the only thing I regret is not buying sooner. Lets see what happen in the future. 1;	0.3	6.5

B00B2BYU1Q	5	Fantastic camera phone I bought this phone for the camera. It does amazingly well in low light, which is rare even among newer cell phones. The call quality was good, and the phone was easy to use. Be prepared for a limited selection of apps. As of 10/2015 the Windows Phone app store is still mostly spam and spyware. Some of the major companies are represented (Facebook, Twitter, etc), but for every valid, safe app there are at least 5 spam apps that try to masquerade as the real thing. Unfortunately for me, almost everything I do is integrated into my Google account. You can check Gmail on the Windows Phone OS, but getting your calendar to sync is very hard - even for a techie like me. There is no app for Google Voice and no way to easily integrate Voice into the phone's calling. I just have to stick with Android. 1;	0.1	5.2

B00CQAOIIC	5	Still my favorite Windows Phone Still my favorite Windows Phone. And my fav. nokia phone. I have the Icon now, but still love my 928. The camera is great if you want great photos and lenses to play with. The quality on the photos and video are a highlight of the phone. It's a speedy phone. It handles games very well, as well as some big apps. The screen is sweet and the color control over the screen is nice as well. The size is great and while some, if not many, like to complain about weight, i feel that phones need a little weight. This has a little weight and it suits it extremely well. It's not awkward or heavy on the wrist (in my opinion) Fits great in the back pocket or inside jacket pocket comfortably. I have, many times, sat down on multiple different surfaces with my phone in my back pocket and never felt it for hours sometimes, and even fell on my a$$ and nothing broke. (thumbs up) I have also dropped this pretty bad a few times, thanks to my stupidity, and it's survived quite well. Of course, a cell phone can only take so much. I plan on replacing my screen (that STILL isn't cracked). If you like Nokia, Lumia's and WM, go for it. 1;	0.4	9.3
B00CQAOIIC	5	1st Windows phone, not so scary and love it. Really solid phone. This was the first windows phone me or my wife had ever had in our lives and I mainly got it because of Cortana. Cortana is amazing btw (even though google now has caught up), the user interface with the tiles are really neat and you can organize them any way you want including the sizes of the tiles. With the live tiles on, they update automatically and instantly when something comes up instead of just a notification that pops up at the top. The phone itself is well built and meant to take a drop or two and pretty sleek on the design so it has alot of plusses that me and the wife like. One of the only downsides so far are the settings, the settings do not allow you to manage and deal with apps as a singular unit the way android does, so it makes for a slightly annoying experience when you want apps to not run in the background, or just shut off completely, but it's doable. 1;	0.4	4.6
B00CQAOIIC	5	This is an awesome smartphone Where do I start? I guess since it's a phone I'll start with the voice quality. It is as clear as a land line, and that has not always been my experience with smart phones. I've had numerous other smartphones, the most recent an HTC Thunderbolt that had fairly poor call quality. The speaker phone has great quality too. The camera is incredible. Even the front facing camera produces high quality photos, and the phone has a number of built-in photo editing features. I've been trying to find a receipt scanning software program that will replace manually entering my business expenses, but the cameras on my other portable devices don't have good enough resolution for those great programs to work. Last night I tried scanning on my 928 and it came out crystal clear. That brings me to Windows Apps. That is the one weakness with this phone. I didn't realize how much I was going to miss the huge selection of Android apps. Windows has all the basics in productivity, games, entertainment, but just doesn't have as much to choose from. I'm sure that will improve with time. I bought the wireless charging pad and love it. No hooking the phone up to it. I just lay the phone on the charging pad (which does have to be plugged in to the wall or a computer). This phone charges faster than any smartphone I've had in the past. However, if you're using programs heavy on graphics like games, it goes through battery pretty quickly. I'm not getting nearly as much time per charge as I expected. The fact that it has a sealed battery means that I can't just pop in a spare battery when I run down, so it's essential to have a portable battery to plug into on the go or a phone charging cable. Customizing the home screen is easy, making it convenient to access the icons I need most often. The only button placement I don't like is the camera button. I take dozens of accidental pictures every day because that button is fairly sensitive and is placed on the side right where the heel of my hand fits. If I change to hold it in my left hand, my little finger rests on that button and triggers it. Hopefully I'll get used to this problem and adjust my touch. The phone has a good heft to it, feeling like it's made of good quality materials, but not so heavy that it bothers me. I have fairly large hands for a woman, and it fits just right in my hand. I bought this phone on the recommendation of a friend who has much smaller hands than I and the size is no problem for her. Overall, I'm happier with this phone than any I've owned in the past. 1;	0.3	14.6
B00CQAOIIC	5	Great smart phone Nokia is really pushing the Windows Phone 8 system with great hardware and software. This is the first phone I have ever had with such a clear screen in direct sunlight. I work outdoors, not in an office, and readability of the screen is great. The camera and built in sky drive storage is great, you can take a picture and in just a few seconds it is in your sky drive, no need to manually upload or anything. The battery on the phone is also good, most days it will last 8+ hours with no extra charging. I do not use many apps but the ones I wanted are here, Skype, Netflix, Pandora, Microsoft Office, Facebook, and USA Today. If you use a Windows 8 PC the syncing with Sky drive is great, the only real cons for the phone is the limited number of cases to choose from and no real otter box type rugged cases. 1;	0.4	3.8
B00CQAOIIC	5	I really like it I really like this phone thus far. I really like Nokia in general. I think Nokia is a goo brand to choose, also the windows phones are very very popular in Europe, Americans don't seem to get it. I find the interfacing really fun, easy to customize and I really like the camera. I find that I accidentially hit the camera button all the time. For this reason I prefer the Nokia Lumia 900, but Verizon wouldn't let me use my unlocked 900 b/c it had am at&t logo. So, I found this one for cheap if I continue my contract for another 2 years. I am really happy I was able to get a the next version lumia from Verizon. They have such a crummy selection in store, only the very expensive ones, and the clerks in store are so rude where I live. I am very happy with my online experience. I just wish I didn't have to pay for a data plan since it is possible to use the phone with data disabled. 1;	0.2	5.2

This is a great phone! -The Nokia stock Apps like HERE maps, HERE drive, Nokia Music and City Lens are absolutely amazing. - I found that this syncs flawlessly with my Windows 8 touch screen computer so that's a plus. And I hear if I get MS Office 365 I can update my word and excel files on my phone and then access those updated files on my computer. -I was also surprised that even though I had to create a Live.com account, I was still able to sync my Google information. I'm currently using Gmail which synced perfectly, got my Google contacts in seconds and my Google calendar syncs just as fast as I can input the data. -The phone has a nice quality weight and a very sleek design. -The camera quality exceeded my expectations especially for capturing objects or people in motion without the photo coming out blurry. -I don't feel like I need a case for it to protect it. I'll probably get one for style later on though. -Now I'm spoiled with the wireless charging.

B00CQAOIIC	5	"Best OS and Phone Yet \The 928 is by far my favorite smart phone to date. I have enjoyed using the android and Apple systems, but in my opinion the 928/window 8 OS takes it to the next level of function and ease of use. An overview includes: 1. The new Windows 8 OS is intuitive, well presented visually and very easy to use. My favorite yet. 2. The app's that I have used in the past are available in Windows 8, so I do not see either Android or Apple having any real advantage. The Nokia app's for photo, maps and music are actually top notch, unlike most of the bloat that comes under most suppliers branding. 3. The camera is a standout feature of this unit. Coupled with the photo programs available through Windows 8, this is a true \""\""takeover\""\"" camera for all but the better SLR's. 4. My battery life has been over 24 hours with moderate use 5. The signal pick up of the Wi-Fi has been a pleasant surprise. Areas of poor reception on my Android and Apple handsets come through with solid signals and amazingly fast performance. Nice! 6. I live in a poor reception area for Verizon and would see one bar or 3g a lot  especially with my Apple. Not so with the 928. For the first time with a smart handset;"""	0.3	8.9
B00CQAOIIC	5	You will love the simplicity of Windows Phone 8. Lots of good APPS. My first Smartphone. I think I chose Windows Phone by default, because I couldn't get an Android because my nephew is a rabid Droid fan. I couldn't go with iPhone just because. When I first started using it I was very happy with it. I learned how to get more apps. and only download apps with good reviews. But the screen froze up on me about 3 times. That really scared me. Two times I took it to Verizon and they showed me how to hold the on button and the up and down button down at the same time to get it to power off. It has been good for a long while now. The updates have resolved some minor issues and filled out some capabilities. I am very happy with the hardware and the software. The app store has some very good apps. OK, we were at my mother in law's and my nephew was bragging on his Droid and saying how Windows phone doesn't have good apps. We were putting in a dishwasher. He and his dad both dutifully shined their flashlight apps under the sink to hook it up. Then I turned on my Level app to set the correct level of the dishwasher. Josh was like, Oh Cool. I out apped him. 1;	0.3	9.6
B00CQAOIIC	5	Best phone I've ever owned I've owned numerous android phones and had an iphone 4 before switching to the HTC 8X windows Phone. That phone sold me on the windows operating system. The 928 has sold me on Nokia as a phone maker. This is by far the nicest phone I've ever owned. For review sake, I'll compare it to the 8x: Bigger, brighter, and considerably sharper screen, longer battery life, blazing fast, more memory built in, and of course access to nokia exclusives. The biggest complaint against windows phone is the app store lagging behind android and Itunes in terms of the number of apps. well unless you are an app happy person who has to own every app in the market, windows phone has many popular apps and games, more official apps on the way, and comparable apps. 90% of the apps in the other stores are garbage apps or ones you won't use anyway. I swear by windows phone and recommend it to everyone. Now that I own the 928, I swear by this phone and nokia as well. Buy it, you won't be disappointed. 1;	0.4	7.2
B00CQAOIIC	5	Glad I pulled the trigger on this one.. After hesitating for more than 3 months about WP in general and the lack of apps etc, I finally pulled the trigger on this one. Happy that i did it. Nokia has done an awesome job. The design is awesome and WP does good too. Battery @2000mAh is great. If you dont switch on WiFi it lasts even longer. Here's what I liked most - Nokia - sleek design, awesome camera/camcorder, Nokia HERE apps are ultimate, Nokia Music is great..I downloaded the mix offline to hear and its great...I even found good collection of my mother tongue songs which I did nto expect to see. WP8 is great - I like the tile concept, the interface. For my gmail and yahoo, I just used the inbuilt mail client rather than the specific app. Happy so far on that. Only thing missing is a one-tap-call feature. In WP8 its two taps. Hope my experience continues just like this... 1;	0.5	7.8
B00CQAOIIC	5	Bluetooth and Toyota Prius The Bluetooth 3.0 on this phone is the best I have used yet. I can stream from the Nokia Music App or the other popular streaming services and it shows the song info perfectly in my 2012 Toyota Prius. It also does the Address book sync and the incoming text message to voice with spoken reply without a hitch. There are plenty of Apps in the store for my needs. I love that I can play XBOX Arcade games that earn Gamer Points. I'm impressed on how I can adjust the size and placement of the tiles. The battery life is great. I can talk on the phone during my 45 min commute one or both ways or stream music via Bluetooth both ways and I'll still have 3/4 battery left at the end of the day. So far I can't find fault with anything with the phone. I love it! My only issue is finding a horizontal holster that it fits in. 1;	0.6	7.9
B00CQAOIIC	5	Microsoft Hits a Homer This is the best phone I have owned. It has a larger display than iPhone but still fits nicely in the pocket. The live tiles provide useful, continually updated information, the camera is great with lots of creative apps, and you have Microsoft Office right on your phone. The user interface is intuitive and smooth. The built in navigation system is clear and accurate, with spoken directions if desired. It finds locations by name quickly and directs you to them while you drive. I prefer it to my Garmin. There is nothing I don't like about this phone. 1;	0.4	5.7
B00CQAOIIC	5	Nokia Lumia 928 I wanted to get away from a Droid for a while mainly because of the battery drainage. This one drains about as much as well but I have to face the facts, if you want a smart phone that is what you're going to have to deal with. But for the most part, I like it. I am a computer technician and used to techy stuff. This is quite simple compared to a droid once you learn it. It has plenty of apps. I just don't like that it doesn't have flash on it so I can't play my fb games etc... I can watch video's however. If you want a phone that is more like Window's this is what you need. 1;	0.2	4.2

It is so easy to use and has all the apps that I need and use on a regular basis. I have no complaints. I am a verizon customer so I upgraded my phone through Amazon for .01 cent. Verizon was asking for $99.00. I paired mine with the fat boy charging station for a great charge. I highly recommend this phone and the windows operating system! 1;	0.5	5.3
B00CQAOIIC	5	Great phone, made even better with Cortana I love this phone. I really like the layout and Cortana is awesome. While there are not quite as many apps as iOS or Android there is more than enough for me (and there are new ones all the time). 1;	0.4	1.9
B00CQAOIIC	5	This phone replaces the same model that I loved. I am very pleased with the windows format This phone replaces the same model that I loved. I am very pleased with the windows format. It is easy to work with and use. 1;	0.7	3.6
B00CQAOIIC	5	Definite buy! I have used an iPhone for years. I saw this phone and figured that it would play nice with my new Windows 8 Tablet; and boy was I right. This is a fan-tastic device! It is very intuitive and more user friendly than an iOS device. Granted there aren't as many applications for Windows 8, but they are coming. This phone is a definite buy! 1;	0.3	2.9
B00CQAOIIC	5	A Recommended Buy! The phone actually works better than the original phone I purchased from Verizon! This phone replaces my old 928. 1;	0.4	1.7
B00CQAOIIC	5	The LASER Phone has arrived! OK, so the early production code name for this phone was the Verizon Laser. Too bad they didn't stick with ; ) it but I can understand why. This is the perfect business phone. The good (not necessarily in order of importance): 1) Windows UI: So much better than android and iOS in my opinion. I upgraded from an iphone 4 which was also an awesome device, but the usability of the Windows Phone OS is so much better, fluid, and easier to manage. iOS just seemed clunky to use in my opinion, even after over a year of heavy use. The Windows phone OS is really a mix of iOS and Android, easier to use than Android but offers more flexibility than iOS. 2) Skydrive: Not perfect yet but very awesome none the less. I'm using the Windows 8.1 preview on my tablet/laptop and Skydrive is integrated now into your document libraries. Auto upload of photos and documents from the phone are available through explorer in Windows 8 and vice versa. It's also handy to have skydrive available from a web browser. No more dropbox for me! It works very well and there was no setup required with the exception of having a Microsoft account. 3) Nokia Exclusive Apps: Not enough is said about Nokia's app lineup. Photobeamer, the camera app, the augmented reality apps, all very cool and useful. Their GPS navigation app works very well and is fun to use. 4) The camera: Top notch awesome photos, good zoom, easily the best camera I have played with on a phone. Night time photos look awesome as well thanks to the fancy flash. 5) Office: Out of the box editing word, powerpoint, and excel on the go! Sure, you aren't going to build a whole business presentation on a phone, but making quick edits is very handy. The email app is far superior to android and ios for my business use. 6) Hardware: Very high quality! The screen is top notch, very vivid colors and deep blacks. Videos look amazing. The 928 can hold its own up to a Samsung Galaxy and iPhone. The buttons are well placed, the speaker is loud and clear. Calls are much clearer than my iPhone was. I really like the placement of all buttons on the phone as well. Good spacing and easy to access. I'll also note that it went flying out of my hand screen down into a gravel parking lot. After letting out a loud sissy squeak, I was relieved to find no visible scratches on the screen. Very impressive. With that in mind, cases for this device are pretty limited for now as well as the screen protectors. 7) XBOX Live: True they don't have the selection of games that Android or iOS does, but the integration of your XBOX live account is very well done and fun to use. NBA Jam is really fun and the controls/touchscreen work great. 8) I could go on about more little things I love about this phone but will cut it short. This is the only Windows Phone you should consider in my opinion. If you are an app fanatic, the Windows OS may not be a good choice yet as they grow the app store. I will say the apps they do have are high quality. For business use, the Nokia with Windows is the clear choice. I may be a little biased towards Windows as an admin, but also enjoy and respect Apple and Google's interfaces as well. The Bad: 1) I really don't have any complaints yet after a month of use. A couple freeze ups (thankfully no blue screens!) easily fixed by a reboot. If you are considering this phone, GET IT. You will be satisfied. 1;	0.4	25.5

B00CS2ZWKQ	5	good times I never bothered to review this phone but since microsoft no longer has any interest in capturing or dominating the mobile phone space I have no choice but to reluctantly consider other options from the android side of the fence. I figured it couldn't hurt to still post this review as a tribute to this phone for its years of loyal service. The advent of the samsung galaxy S8 is probably the first time glance screen has been adopted by another phone manufacturer and that's comforting since I genuinely cannot live without that feature on my phone. I also own the newer supposedly better lumia 930 but despite having a better camera somehow the 925 just works better for me as a daily phone. If the windows phone platform was still receiving app support and sensible updates I would honestly keep using this phone for another couple of years. 1;	0.0	3.1
B00CS2ZWKQ	5	Great phone, great job by nokia The switch to aluminium from what I thought was a gaudy and bulky poly carbonate plastic casing the 920 has is a huge step in the right direction. This phone is great all around. I am a big fan of windows phone so I am completely fine with the OS and its current standing with it's app limitations. The phone itself is great and the different suites of apps that nokia provides makes all the difference. I used to have the HTC 8x. That was also a great phone although the lumia 925 has the better features, better battery life, and camera quality. The only thing the HTC 8x outdid compared to the lumia 925 was sound quality via headset and/or speakers. Of course HTC has the upside of using Beats technology and built-in extra amps, but the difference in quality seems incredibly noticeable even after messing with the equalizer in settings. Overall though, great phone. I hope Microsoft continues to improve the lumia lines in the same matter as Nokia as done so far. 1;	0.5	6.0
B00CS2ZWKQ	5	Perfect condition phone Perfect condition phone. It has some quirks working on AT&T being the international version. No really issues, but takes a bit more setup time and things like SoftCard only work currently on AT&T branded phone. 1;	0.4	1.9
B00CS2ZWKQ	5	Takes great pictures in low lighting. For the price, this is the best window smartphone out there. I like the tiles look. LOVE the camera! It takes very nice pictures in low lighting. 1;	0.6	3.8
B00CS2ZWKQ	5	Love it to bits Love it to bits, had it now for a few months and has never acted up or failed me. Now with the new update which includes cortana the phone just keeps getting stronger. The built quality and camera is really what sold it for me. Would Recommend. 1;	0.3	1.5

B00CS2ZWKQ	5	Phone seems to be network unlocked! Note that this item looks like it was an open box or returned soon after first purchase. The phone looks brand new though with no visible signs of ware.

Downloaded the Spanish keyboard just in case but didn't need it. The phone updated pretty quick with no problems, and I am quite happy with it. 1;	0.4	2.9
B00CS2ZWKQ	5	Fantastic Phone... For the past 10 years I was a HTC crazy. I had a dozen. I do not regret the change! For the firat time I see a product that had not just tech put in it, but it was carefully crafted and also very well designed. It is not perfect yet! as technology has it limitations still. The Nokia Apps gives some edge to it, and i am in love with it... Can't stop exploring... Nokia has given WP a bit of more salt. If you are not yet a WP person, just try this beauty and you will see... 1;	0.4	5.5
B00DUJ6TYY	5	Works with Simple Mobile I was worried it wouldn't work with Simple Mobile (a sub carrier of T-Mobile), but it works well. It seems to flip between 3G and Edge a lot, but that happened on my HTC as well. Oh, and to get internet I had to use the top SIM slot. I tried the bottom one first, but that only gave me phone service. The phone itself seems to be as fast or faster than my HTC One X. I don't think this can really be the case though as the HTC was a quad core and faster processors I believe, but for whatever reason, this phone performs extremely well and seems to be more stable. Battery life is okay, but I wasn't expecting much there as it's such a large screen. Really happy with the purchase. Phone is fantastic, especially when you factor in the price. 1;	0.2	5.0

Its 2.5 gb of unlimited service and then it drags to a unbelievable slow crawl. If you purchase this phone go with a good service plan.

B00E6FGSHY	5	I really like this phone I really like this phone. It has some great features on it. The only frustrating thing is if you are used to having a sliding keypad with your phone then this one can be frustrating because of the touch tone keypad , but many of the words & numbers will automatically pop up to help you in advance as you are typing which does help when you are texting to others. It is a really nice phone though & a nice camera on it also. 1;	0.5	2.8
B00E6FGSHY	5	Happy Upgrade Upgraded from Galaxy S2 Skyrocket. Love this phone! Decided to get my daughter a cell phone, and she couldn't be happier. It was a debate between the S4 & S5, but the S4 won out. I've always had Samsung smartphones - very brand loyal. As long as Samsung keeps on putting out quality products, they have a customer for life. 1;	0.4	3.2
B00E6FGSHY	5	A hidden GemS4U The Samsung S4 exceeds my expectations for what a cellphone should be and what it really is. The speed of the phone, call clarity, and battery life make this a must for people on the go. A phone that if you are not into the lines for Apple iphone, then give the Samsung S4 a try. Doesn't cost anything to look! 1;	0.1	1.9
B00E6FGSHY	5	Too much bloatware! Too much bloatware I'll never use and can't delete. It's always wanting to update and load my memory w junk. Pay attn Samsung! Not all users are young and always on public sharing sites. The phone works well for me...intuitive, easy to use. 1;	-0.2	3.6

B00E6FGSHY	5	UPGRADED FROM iPhone 4 Full of features & functions that are not marketed. iPhone is a good phone: intuitive and slightly better camera quality, but this is a great phone, too. Some of the camera features, like taking a photo of something & a selfie at the same time, is not a feature on the Apple device. Can be controlled by voice, dictation, messages can be announced and read; weather can be read; scrolling through a document with eye gestures, enlarging a view with the swipe of a hand...and many more features need to be highlighted more, along with other capabilities. They just didn't market these features with a cute name like Siri.' If you are addicted to the iphone & have fallen prey to its stellar marketing or find it more prestigious to own, you will never be happy with the Galaxy. But, it's a fantastic, forward designed product, and I am glad I switched. 1;	0.1	3.0
B00E6FGSHY	5	Better than iPhone 5s I was debating between the 5S and G4, when i looked online that you can also do slow motion, and fast motion, video I went with the G4. I am not disappointed. I LOVE this phone! I have recently dropped my phone in water. After putting it in rice over night and letting it dry out, I have had no issues with this phone. Everything still works amazing on the phone. The battery life still lasts all day (unless of course I am playing games on it). I had an iphone at one point and dropped it in water and had to replace it to get it to work. If you are trying to decide between apple and samsung... samsung all the way! 1;	0.3	4.5
B00E6FGSHY	5	I switched over the Galaxy S4 and I LOVE IT! I love the customizable features of it First, I was always an Apple user. I had the 3, 4 and 5. When Apple announced the 6 I was sick of there not being anything innovative with their phones but we were spending $200 on a brand. I switched over the Galaxy S4 and I LOVE IT! I love the customizable features of it. I love how there is so much more you can do than the iPhone. I'm some what techy and love my gadgets. It did take quite a bit of time getting comfortable using it after using apple for almost seven years. I even switched my husband from apple to the same phone. We love it. 1;	0.5	8.4

B00E8TGT1S	5	Top Budget Smartphone Why did you choose this rating? For the price is the BEST smartphone you can get. When you have it in your hands you do not believe it has been so cheap. What did you like or dislike? PROS: Windows Phone 8 is very cute and run smoothly most of the time. Camera and Nokia apps make a great job with good light. Here Drive app is the best GPS app in any platform I tried. PS: If you want 3G 850/1900 you may choose model RM-915 (AT&T, Venezuelan Movistar, Movilnet) or RM-917. If you want 3G 900/2100 you may choose model RM-914. CONS: No led flash. Lacks of apps in marketplace. Who would you recommend this to?

B00E92B88I	5	An excellent phone! An unlocked phone offers an excellent way to get a phone of your choice and use it on a network of your choice. While the Moto X was still being made in the US of A, I decided to buy one (patriotism!) knowing that the companies behind it are formidable ones in their technical repertoire and I was already done with my iPhone 4S, which seemed dated in comparison to bigger screened phones which seemed sleeker than the 4S. So far, it has been a blast. I bought a second one from Motorola with 32 GB memory, as they had a special for that one. Very solid phone and zero troubles so far .... except perhaps one -- I could not set up the phone to act as a data conduit for my coporate VPN. 1;	0.7	4.2

B00E92B88I	5	Great phone Just about everything about this phone is positive. It's quick, easy to use on the Android platform, and the best of all its features is that it will tell me without even touching it if I have a text, email, the time, or other notification. Absolutely fantastic design. Battery life seems to be very good, as long as you don't think you need every battery exhausting resource on all the time for no real reason. I use an iphone for work, and it is so crude and impossible to use, transfer files, and modify, that this phone is like a dream. It couldn't be easier. I love this phone and will regret the day that it is no longer usable. It takes drops and falls no problem, the screen must be fairly tough. The only thing I would change with the phone is expandable memory, which is probably a common problem with phones. Other than that, it's great. 1;	0.3	6.2
B00E92B88I	5	The screen is bright and has great color. The phone works like a dream I bought this phone to replace an Motorola Matrix 4G. The screen is bright and has great color. The phone works like a dream. The only thing I've noticed is it doesn't have a led for notifications and messages. It makes up for this by showing the notices on the screen when you move it. With the led you could see if there was a message by looking at the phone without touching it. There is no way to delete multiple messages like I could on my Atrix, and no way to add a signature to text messages. I realize that these issues are the fault of the operating system and not the phone. Battery life is the same as my Atrix about a full day of normal use. Getting the phone activated on AT&T was simple. I thought all I would have to do was put my Sim in the new phone. My old Sim was way to big. Went to the local AT&T store and a new Sim was put in and the tech offered to transfer info for me. I didn't have him do that, but he was very helpful. The whole process took about 10 minutes. Still learning about all the new features and abilities of the much newer phone. I think it is a great phone and would recommend it to anyone. 1;	0.2	9.1
B00E92B88I	5	Very happy with this phone, especially given the price. I'm very happy with this phone so far. I have had it for about 4 months, and I've been pleasantly surprised by what a good phone it is. Pros: *HDR mode takes beautiful landscape photos. Most of the photos I took on a trip to hawaii were in HDR mode, and they looked truly breathtaking. * Scrolling feels smooth * I haven't broken it yet. I broke a S3 and S4 within 90 days of purchase. * Good price * Good looking screen. Colors are vibrant and bright Cons: *Average battery life(10-12 hrs with light to medium use), although certain google apps like maps will completely kill your battery. 1;	0.5	6.7
B00E92B88I	5	Good phone for even better price. Great phone for a cheap price. I bought this to replace a broken Xperia Z1 Compact. It is only slightly larger and I don't even notice it running slower than the Z1-C while it has a slower processor. It still runs games like normal and usual phone functions are great. Only downside is that it isn't waterproof like the xperia, but that isn't what broke my xperia anyway. Also it works with T-mobile 4G-LTE in USA. 1;	0.3	4.7
B00E92B88I	5	Moto X - like Nexus 5 but with better camera Moto X - like Nexus 5 but with better camera (even the smaller screen with lower resolution isn't noticeable because it is such a great Android Smart Phone). 5 Stars to the Vender (based on TX) for getting the Moto X shipped out via FedEx Ground so quickly - do I care if the cable / plug is white? No because I can see that in the dark (grins) .... 1;	0.3	1.6
B00E92B88I	5	new phone, great price, data migration was perfect. This phone was sold as good condition but I can say it is like new and even came with the box cables and instructions.

Also since I went from motox to motox it migrated perfectly. 1;	0.1	2.4
B00E92B88I	5	Awesome in the palm of your hand This phone is AWESOME!!!! I have no queries in regards to the condition it came in. It said new, it came new. But back to this phone.

B00ECAABBC	5	"King of Camera Phones \I have to say, this is a phone I've wanted for sometime! I love Nokia's windows phones and especially those beautifully designed cameras! I am not one to write reviews, but if you have a chance to purchase this product I don't think you will regret! I was so pleased to see also there was NO at&t logo on this unlocked device. I am currently using T-Mobiles service with the 1020. I understand some people maybe taken by the \""\""lack of apps\""\"" for windows  but they are on the rise and do need developers for the system. I just hope that doesn't shy people away from such a great device. I was using a iPhone 6 before buying the 1020 and can say you'll service.

B00ECAABBC	5	Pretty Cool I bought this specifically for the camera, which is phenomenal. The pics are remarkable, much better than my Fuji Digital camera, and the video is in 1080 and flawless. There are several camera apps which are very helpful, a burst mode which chooses the best shot as well as others for more artistic shots. The camera saves each pic in two ways, 5 megapixels for instant upload and one in 34 megapixel. You can zoom in after the shot and not have that pixelated faded look, seeing is believing! Now the O S is Windows, I have an Ipod Touch and a Android Tablet but this is fairly straight forward. There aren't nearly the Apps those others have BUT I have ALL the same ones I used on those other devices. For my cell service I use Consumer Cellar, 15 dollars a month for 200 minutes, I know that isn't a lot but as I said I bought this for the camera. I am one happy camper which is why I gave it 5 stars. 1;	0.4	5.2

B00EKXDL0E	5	Bigger Is Better I've had it for over 1 yr and love it. Size does matter. I have a Kindle in addition to this device but I don't take it with me always. The Mega is great then for reading books, watching a movie or playing a game. The sound quality is very good esp. when I'm using the speaker. The battery charges very quickly and lasts all day with average use. Heavy use? You can buy a backup battery at Amazon at a low price. For anyone concerned about the size-don't be unless you're wearing skin tight jeans. That being said it seems 2014 was the last yr for this size & version. The present one is smaller-not by much but enough. And that's too bad! 1;	0.1	4.2
B00EKXDL0E	5	best phone so far for the price best phone i have so far. I can even remote to computers. I added a usb mouse and a bluetooh keyboard. its really that good. It handles navigation, Wifi, bluetooh, pandora, all my emails, and video, several more applications for my reminders, waze, etc... and works just fine! sometime I drained the memory just to keep it light.

B00EKXDL0E	5	Mega Big phone I got this for my husband because he had seen people with big phones all over SE Asia and he wanted one too. He wanted to be able to use his phone like a tablet; but not as big as a tablet. This meets his requirements! It is easy to see what you are doing, both with texting and surfing the web. I had to order this online because the stores do not seem to carry it. He rarely TALKS on the phone, so he felt super big would be no problem and he was right. Took a little while (get used to) to move from Iphone to new format; however they are similar enough that I had no problems setting it up for him. He LOVES it! 1;	0.3	3.7

B00F2SDM00	5	"According to how I feel about the product that I have purcahsed so far. \I am an Apple product user. I have a Macbook pro, I use an iMac and iPads at work, and so on, so I have a grasp of Apple's OSx. I was afraid that the switch and learning a new program would be difficult but that wasn't the case at all. There are some things that Apple does better and vica versa but I am standing with my decision. Not because I am bound a 2yr contract now but because I have tried them both and this fits me better. I was afraid that this might be one of those \""\""too\""\"" good to be true thing since the product goes for $179 (+ data plan and taxes) w/a 2yr contract on Amazon and nearly twice as much (+ data plan and taxes) at the stores. But seeing that the sellers are Amazon  I took the chance. If this was a \""\""knock-off\""\"" then they have done a very good job :). FYI I believe that Staples is selling the Note 3 for 1 cent w/a 2yr agreement. But the catch is that you have to have never had a phone contract before;"""	0.1	2.9
B00F2SDM00	5	State of the Art Smartphone to date! We in the family have own several galaxy models like S2, S3, S4, and note 2. Every model that came out was always a striking revelation and improvement of the previous. Now I just upgraded to Note 3 (AT & T) and I couldn't ask for more. It's capabilities and functions are just mind blowing. And with its huge size, it's a 2 into 1 deal you can get, a smartphone and mini-tablet in rolled into one. I don't need to carry with me now either my ipad or tab alongside with my smartphone. I can always drive and travel light with it. The battery is very impressive and it could last me 2 days with the LTE 4G on all the way. Processor, touchscreen and graphic user interface are fast and responsive. Screen resolution is so crystal clear and vivid. I am totally happy with this guy and couldn't ask for more. 1;	0.5	6.8
B00F2SDM00	5	Good phone on a contract I'm on AT&T contract, so when it came time to upgrade I got this gorgeous phone. The only downside is locked bootloader. But ROM devs still came thru with rooting and some international ROMs are ported. So freedom is still there. Rooting allows me to remove some unneeded programs and also save some battery with Greenify app - to gain full control of my phone in other words. Other thoughts: if you are looking for contract free phone with big screen and GPE like experience and unlocked bootloader - look at Sony Xperia Z Ultra or Samsung Galaxy Note3 for T-Mobile. 1;	0.3	3.0
B00F2SDM00	5	Best Phone Ever Best phone I've ever owned. I gave my iphone 5 away once I saw one of these and orders this beauty as soon as I could. I've had it for a few months now and I'll never give up on samsung, especially if they keep up the larger sized phones. Once you start using a phone of this size you won't be able to imagine going back to a tiny little 2 inch phone that you can barely use. If you use your phone a lot then you will love how much more room you have to work with on the Note. 1;	0.2	3.9
B00F2SDM00	5	Better than the iPhone 6 plus. Best phone ever. I am amazed Samsung is not leading the market in phones. My only regret is I was not able to get the Note 4. But if, like me, you can't get the Note 4 this is a great phone. The many things you can do with the stylus alone make it worth it. It is even a better phone than the 6 plus. It is versatile. I also got a Galaxy Gear to go with it. Really why anyone would choose an iPhone over this boggles my mind. Samsung was the first to make Phablets. Apple even made fun of it. 1;	0.3	5.4
B00F2SDM00	5	Love it! So far so good! I've had this phone for a couple of months now and it is head and shoulders above the previous phone I had (Samsung Skyrocket). Battery lasts all day with plenty left over (I use it constantly through out the day). It's responsive to my touch and with the S pen. I'm still learning everything it can do so I'll have to add to this post at a later date when I figure it all out. 1;	0.5	3.8
B00F2SDM00	5	"Holy Powerful phone. \I am sure that all of you know all the stats and the \""\""tricks\""\"" off of YouTube videos.

B00F2SDM00	5	Worth the cost. So this was the first phone I actually paid for out of my own money that wasn't directly on a contract and I really couldn't be happier with it.

B00F2SDM00	5	Best phone I've ever owned As a previous iPhone user, I was a little skeptical to make the switch over to an Android device. The iPhone was very user friendly and I was comfortable with it. However, I took a leap of faith and grabbed me a Galaxy note 3. It is not much different in terms of being user friendly. It is much faster than my iphone ever was and the screen is huge by comparison. Every now and then my wife will ask me to user her phone to read texts to her while she's driving and the iPhone just looks and feels so tiny to me now. The S-Pen is fun to use with it's numerous apps where it can be utilized like word search games and jotting down quick notes. Samsung really packed a massive amount of technology into this device and it shows. PROS -Huge screen with beautiful color -13 Megapixel camera with numerous settings and filters -The S Pen is creatively utilized -The processor is lightning fast, transitioning between apps is nearly seamless. CONS - S Voice which is Samsung's version of Siri, needs work but they're headed in the right direction. -Rear camera protrudes which makes laying the phone on it's back, susceptible to scratching the lens, however there are many cases that protect it from this. -Can be a little difficult to hold and operate for people with hands on the smaller side. There is a bit of a learning curve, but if you're switching over from an iPhone, you will pick it up in no time. There are many things that can be done with this phone that it is difficult to cover it all, however there are numerous videos on Youtube exploring these cool features. I am 100% happy with my decision going over to an Android and I couldn't have chosen a better phone to do it with. The Galaxy Note 3 is just an amazing piece of technology, plain and simple. 1;	0.3	8.1
B00F2SDM00	5	Phab-let-ulous! The Galaxy Note 3 is an outstanding phone-tablet hybrid. It's really the best of both worlds. The screen is big and beautiful. And the innards are strong, fast and smart. This phone is too good for me. I now sleep on the couch so 主君 Note 3 can have my bed. 1;	0.5	4.3

B00F2SKPIM	5	ATTENTION TRACFONE USERS Amazingly this works with Tracfone. Before we used a iPhone 4s Verizon, bought from Amazon and transferred to Tracfone BYOP successfully and everything still works today. Didn't know of Tracfone's changes, so now it's AT&T, unlocked phones, T-Mobile, and some other various carriers that can be brought into BYOP, not Verizon! (As it was a BYOP carrier before) TRANSFER: Old Tracfone cellphone to this newer samsung. Already had a Sim card meant for the process. (Strangely before the iPhone 4s didn't need a Sim card, still doesn't have one, but still on that Tracfone plan for the iPhone). The BYOP process didn't work right away when we tried transferring it online. Called Tracfone for assistance, blah blah provided information, this that, op nope your phone isn't compatible with Tracfone sorry, and bye. HOWEVER, we tried transferring online again and it worked successfully!! RESULTS: It uses AT&T cell towers, makes calls and everything successfully, Image transfers through text messages is iffy since it can't send multiple images in bulk. Just make sure to go through the steps listed for BYOP, do it once or twice and Image transfer along with data usage should work fine. 1;	0.0	3.8
B00F2SKPIM	5	"Still learning, transitioning from iPhone \Great phone, although I miss the integrated features that the iPhone provides. Excellent battery. I haven't found aftermarket apps, but in my transition i've noticed: What I do love: Great screen size to read everything comfortably, watch video clips, and appreciate pictures. Great battery life. I had to charge the iPhone I had twice a day. This I abuse and it still gets me through the day. It also has a removable battery for instant juice. Family I have in the Philippines have had to charge theirs 3-4 times a day due to the network infrastructure. Responsive In my transition, things I have noticed: -Native list syncing is not present. I decided to go with Wunderlist. I would have used Google Task, but it's not developed yet. -No button that pulls up voice command like Siri does in the lock screen. The voice command is not universal and not as easily accessible like Siri was. You can have it activate in the lock screen with a double tap of the home button, but it doesn't work if the phone is unlocked. If it is unlocked, you have to find the app. There is a buttonless voice activation (\""\""Hi Galaxy\""\"")  but it stops working sometimes. -Google maps will persist in lock mode;"""	0.0	8.5
B00F2SKPIM	5	"So far I am really loving this phone. \I don't use a cell phone a lot, but I love the functionality of this phone. It is more like a mini tablet. The pen that comes with it is very handy, and activates the phone when you pull it out. It is also great for more precise selections and for note taking. I am very happy with the resolution of the screen and the response of both touch and pen. Buying the phone from Amazon and setting up a new Verizon account was painless. I easily got the account and on-line payment set up without a hitch. I also transferred my AT&T phone number to the phone without any problems. I won't reiterate the tech specs of the phone as you can read all of that on the product page. I just want to let you know what I think of it as a user of the phone. At this point in time, I couldn't be happier with this phone or the Verizon service. UPDATE 5/07/16 I've had this phone for a little over 3 years, and I still have no desire to get a new phone. I did, however, recently decide to switch my service provider from Verizon to T-Mobile because of the offerings of T-Mobile which I won't get into. I was assured by the T-Mobile rep that as long as the phone was unlocked, I could replace the Verizon sim card with the one from T-Mobile and the phone would work with no problems after activating the T-Mobile sim card. I am updating this review so that others don't experience what I did if they want to change their provider. First of all, Verizon has never locked any of their 4G phones. Verizon uses a CDMA network which is also used by Sprint and US Cellular, T-Mobile and AT&S use a GSM network. One difference is the polarity used, so phone for each type of network are manufactured to use the specific polarity of the network. The other difference that should be considered by the end user is that on the GSM network customer information is stored on the sim card. This means that you can take the sim card from one phone and insert it into another and it will work.GSM carriers must accept any GSM phone. So they don't have control over the phone you are using. CDMA carriers use network based white lists. So you can only switch phones with your carrier's permission, and the carrier doesn't have to accept any particular phone. There are other differences between the two network types, but those I have mentioned affect the end user the most. In my case, I had to buy a new phone in order to switch to T-Mobile as a carrier. I was also told by Verizon that this phone \""\""may\""\"" work with another CDMA carrier  but it my lose functionality. I have had to buy another phone to use the GSM network;"""	0.1	11.2
B00F2SKPIM	5	Great Phone I bought this phone in December 2013. l still love it. The drawback is its size. l hare small hands and it can be difficult to grasp because it is big.It is also heavier than my previous phones. The size is why I bought it though - l wanted the big screen and it is worth it. lt is very durable. I did put a case on it but it is a lightweight one that only covers the edges and back. I have dropped my phone many times with no damage. Samsung does have a lot of useless programs that come pre-installed but I haven't had issues with those. My battery easily lasts all day most days. If the battery seems to be draining quickly, clearing the cache and restarting the phone seems to solve the problem. The On-screen keyboard is easier to use on the bigger screen. The split windows are now useable. Games are easier to play. Everything is easier to read. One more drawback is that the volume buttons and power button are directly opposite of each other. I often end up pressing both at the same time. The rest of the phone isn't much different from the Galaxy Nexus. the programs are the same. The screens look the same only bigger. 1;	0.2	8.7
B00F2SKPIM	5	Love the phone!!! First of all, I want to say that Amazon price beats any service provider offers out there. Secondly, the quick shipment from amazon and processing is awesome. Now the phone, I love love love everything about it. It is big in size, but how many people have a smartphone plus a tablet. I find this phone serves the purpose of both. I love how everything is in one. I was always in love with the Android operating system, so I never really had much of a problem. I found I got really frustrated with Apple products a lot, and switching to the iPhone was the biggest regret I had made. I just don't like how everything is set up for you and you can't really customize anything. Secondly, I love how the Note syncs with my Google account, from my Gmail to my calendar and my contacts. I am currently taking online classes, and I am able to log on to my school website without a problem. As opposed to my iPhone I can only access certain features, and not to mention constantly having to zoom in. Cons: speaker is on the bottom, so if you watch a movie in landscape, you'll feel like your hearing is off. That's all I can find for it for now. 1;	0.2	8.4
B00F2SKPIM	5	UPDATE!!!! DO NOT INSTALL UPDATE TO ANDROID 5.0 LOLLIPOP Update!!!! Last week (April 28, 2015) Verizon pushed the Android 5.0 Lollipop update for the Note 3. DO NOT INSTALL THE UPDATE!!!!! There have been multiple problems with the update. My particular problem has been if the phone is in a no coverage area for a length of time, when you get back into a coverage area it will not pick the signal back up until you reboot the phone. I am now waiting on my 3rd phone from Verizon to deal with this and their only remedy at this point is not to install the update. Look online before you consider updating and read all the issues with this update. Original Review.... I transitioned from a Motorola Droid Razr Maxx to this Samsung Galaxy Note 3. A difference between night and day. I have literally moved from the worst phone I have ever owned to the absolute best phone I have ever owned. Pros: Quad Core Replaceable / Up-gradable Battery Beautiful Display S-Pen Call Quality Available Accessories App Compatibility Cons: I'll let you know if I find one 1;	-0.2	4.8
B00F2SKPIM	5	Works fine, minor quirks, drop resistant but recommend case on principle, great price Hesitant to write a review until a couple months had passed in case of product failure but here I go. Visually the phone was in great condition besides a few spots about 1mm in length in the lower right bezzel where the plastic has been chipped. Everything came as described and in working condition, I was able to pop my sim csrd in and activste it thr same day. In the past month, I've experienced a few kinks in the OS like the touchscreen not responding for a few seconds and ohone froze once but nothing that a restart couldn't fix. I dont think that this is a problem with the phone but just a byproduct of its aging (3 year old) componants. But these things only happened twice in the last month after heavy usage so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. Overall, getting this phone with its processing power and display was a very good deal for under $200. Despite its age it functions are fluid and dont seem to be slowing down at the moment. Would definately suggest getting a case despite the fact that I've dropped it a few times without one and have yet to get any scratches. 1;	0.0	5.4
B00F2SKPIM	5	Beast Phone! TOP DOG! IMO, best phone out there. Great for multitasking! excellent screen, fast!. lightweight. Camera takes great pictures in good lighting. S-Pen works great! speaker output nice and crisp. Battery life really good, if you turn off some un-needed functions like gestures, turn off GPS when your not needing it, turn off auto sync, and set screen time out to 30 sec.....I been getting easy 2 days without charging with light usage like streaming youtube, web browsing and some email. Call quality very good, can hear callers loud and sharp on Verizon network that is. 4G blazing fast on Verizon. Wifi antenna can be a little stronger. Overall a great phone by Samsung! 1;	0.6	9.9
B00F2SKPIM	5	Amazing Phone !! I LOVE IT !! Love my phone I'm using it now. Only problem is it doesn't come with SIM card. Other than that great quality.

B00F2SKPIM	5	"Cool phone! \I finally had to break down and purchase a new phone to replace the flip I had been using for about 10 years. I chose this because it was highly rated by all the reviews I read and I absolutely refused to be a moronic lemming and purchase an iPOS. The price through Amazon was better than what I could do through Verizon and the setup was absolutely painless. I am NOT too thrilled about the $50 increase in my monthly bill, but that's what you get for going from a no-frills flip phone to a \""\""phablet\""\"".\"" 1;"""	0.1	2.9
B00F2SKPIM	5	Super great price, Verizon not very interested in settibg it up. Can't beat price and not even refurbished. Saved over 400.00 will buy next phone this eay. Only problem, my Verizon store was really not very interested in transferring photos and setting it up without them selling it to me. Main drawback. 1;	0.0	1.7
B00F2SKPIM	5	Very fun item! Fantastic, never had a Smartphone before, and it's nice to know that it is user friendly. Very much fun, and going to have a heck of a time figuring all the cool things out. I especially love the stylus since I hate using my fingers to work on a screen. I always feel like my fingers are going to smudge up the screen, so the stylus really helps me out with that. Not tried any of the apps yet, but I'm probably going to be doing a lot of exploring on it, as I said. Excellent phone, and tons of fun. Even my husband, who is through Tracfone, was considering on getting one through his provider. All my phones have been Samsungs, from the first phone which I cannot remember the name of, to my Samsung Intensity II, and now my Samsung Galaxy Note 3. I love it! 1;	0.5	6.4
B00F2SKPIM	5	Would Buy from again It is exactly as it was described. It works perfectly, with minor scratches. It came with all the necessary items to use for a day to day basis. The cell phone company had no issue of making this phone my primiary cell phone. 1;	0.6	3.2
B00F2SKPIM	5	Love my new Note 3 Love my new Note 3! Great features...one being that I can actually see it! I was worried about moving away from my old smart phone with a slide out keyboard as I'm part of the...ahem...more mature crowd and my eyes & fingers aren't what they used to be. No problems whatsoever...I text like a pro on this! 1;	0.4	3.1
B00F2SKPIM	5	Kills the iPhone 5 I traded to this from the iphone 5. It was the greatest change in my life. I love this phone i can go 20 hours easily even more. If you leave it in stand bye mode you can leave it for days. I just wish it had kitkat for verizon. I also wish there was a nice dock for it. Its awkward because of the usb 3.0. Its a different plug and if you use the old 2.0 connection it takes long to charge it 1;	0.1	3.7
B00F2SKPIM	5	awesome! I'm an apple guy, but also travel a lot. when I saw this I tried it and am a convert. with a portable keyboard it's all I need when I travel overseas. I won't take my macbook or my ipad on the next trip. this note 3 will do it all and it's awesome. I love it and will be giving my iphone to my daughter shortly.....it's a trade up for me! I highly recommend it. 1;	0.5	5.4
B00F2SKPIM	5	LOVE IT I have used many apple and Android products... This is the first phone I can say that I loved. Yes, the screen is huge, but that's a good thing! It does fit in your pocket (It fits everywhere my last phone did). Battery is good but not amazing. I usually get a day and a half out of it, but I have killed in less than a day by playing games/browsing for 4+ hours. 1;	0.3	2.8
B00F2SKPIM	5	Extremely happy with this decision Without getting all technical.... if you don't need the latest greatest (S6, S6 Edge, Note4) this thing is a powerhouse unto itself. I am very happy with my decision and for the price ($20 with 2yr contract) how could I not be? 1;	0.5	1.7
B00F2SKPIM	5	Take A Note Way better than my old LG G2. If you use your phone a lot, like I do, then it wouldn't hurt to invest in a couple of extra batteries. Other then that, phone is great: no lagging, no crashing of any kind. 1;	0.3	1.5
B00F2SKPIM	5	THIS IS THE BEST PHONE EVER!! The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 on Verizon Wireless picks up right where its predecessor left off, making key upgrades to the design and display, while adding a bevy of new stylus features.

B00F2SKPIM	5	"Could only be better if someone other than Samsung made it \I love the phone. It has worked superbly for me. I came from a much simpler phone, so getting used to all of the options was a bit challenging but very fun at the same time. There are two things I'd like to talk about with this phone: Size, and Samsung's Customer Service. Size: I can never go back to a smaller screen. I really don't care that sometimes it is tough to reach some of the letters when texting or that I almost drop it sometimes when I don't have a good grip on it. I love having so much screen real estate! I love it and I will never go back. In general though, I don't have much trouble texting on it or using it one handed even without enabling the special one handed use feature. I'm 6'2\""\"" so I'm somewhat taller than average  so it may be that I'm just large enough for the size to be a good fit. Samsung's Customer Service: Terrible. I don't think they really get how it's supposed to be done. I don't think they really understand how to please customers the right way. That's probably why they have so many useless features all piled on the phone. Get rid of some of them and make others just plain work better! Anyway;"""	0.1	8.8

B00F2SKPIM	5	Fantastic phone I loved all the specs on this phone when I was doing my research. For the most part it seemed that the phone was pretty solid for performance based on everything I was reading. My primary concern going in was the issue that I kept seeing appear regarding the call quality. I finally pulled the trigger when I saw that there was a fix for that issue. I have had the phone for over a month now and I can report that I have had no issues with any aspect of the phone. Call quality has been great. I have had no problems with running any apps and even multiple apps at a time, it does not lag. The battery life is the best of any phone I have ever owned. Even better than the extended battery I had for my previous phone. I can typically go at least 2 days on a charge. I consider myself to be an average user of the phone. On a typical day I will run several apps, send and receive multiple texts, do some surfing and make several phone calls. The size of the phone may be the sticking point for some people. I was a little hesitant in this respect also at first, but I can say that I got used to the size in a very short time and now can't imagine myself with a smaller phone. I love it. I think this phone was a great purchase and am not disappointed in it at all. 1;	0.4	8.9
B00F2SKPIM	5	Great phone. Have had it over a month now ... Great phone. Have had it over a month now and am extremely pleased with the Note 3. I had the Samsung Galaxy S III and was 2 yrs old. Was time to upgrade. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has a solid reputation and rather than wait for the Note 4 with no track record I opted for the Note 3. Glad I did. Only one caveat I have found is do not buy a protective case that has a magnetic closure tab because that can interfere with the note hand writing function. Have had no issues getting used to thise phablet sized phone. In fact I find I'm preferring it because the screen is larger, makes texting much easier. Camera is surprisingly good for indoor photos but finding it's not as great for brightly lit scenes such as taking shots of landscapes using auto. Better off using the manual settings for that. 1;	0.3	7.2
B00F2SKPIM	5	Great device I'm an Android (and Samsung) fan....and this phone just validated that for me!! Call quality was improved from my Nexus Prime. Battery life is better. The screen is beautiful. The s-pen is nifty to use. I was daunted by the size initially, but i didn't notice it after a few days of use. A good cover to help your grip is definitely beneficial. Now, other phones tend to look comically small...funny how you adjust to it. Also, watching how-to/tip videos helped me quickly learn how to best use the device. This is my favorite phone in 15+ years....highly recommended (if the features appeal to your preferences, that is). 1;	0.5	7.0
B00F2SKPIM	5	Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32 GB This is by far the best phone on the planet. I replaced my Samsung Galaxy Nexus with this phone. The improvements are so vast it would take me all day to explain them. And since I don't get paid for my reviews, I'll just say this. If you want a really good smart phone, with a screen just slightly smaller than a tablet, that can do just about anything you can imagine, then this would be the phone for you.. But get it from Amazon.. You'll get a better deal....Verizon wanted the same money for only the 16 Gig version. . Also as a side note, Samsung makes a Smart watch that goes with this bad boy. Totally incredible technology... 1;	0.1	3.7
B00F2SKPIM	5	Here's a note....The Galaxy Note blows everything else out of the water. A fan of the Motorola Droids I was little leery to make a change. I first tried the newer Galaxy S5. It was pretty much all plastic and felt cheap, so I decided to try the Note. I did a lot of research and the Note 4 for the price wasn't really worth the $299 especially with the Note 3 at $99 for almost the same specs (NOW ONLY $1). Beautiful Display Extremely Responsive Intuitive Metal Bezel feels sturdy, gives a little heft, but the phone is in no way heavy Even better with Go Launcher I've barely used my tablet, because the screen is so clear and just big enough to do anything I want. Many more features made me fall in love with the Note 3. 1;	0.0	4.6
B00F2SKPIM	5	I am so happy with this phone I am so happy with this phone. Upgraded from a RAZR for the larger screen. I have to say, I am impressed with Amazon - they sent a separate email with activation instructions / phone # which took maybe 2 minutes, immediate activation ! I am amazed with the capabilities of this phone - the clarity of the screen is fantastic. I live in a rural area and the reception is the same as my old phone. I inserted my previous SD card and I am able to access everything. It shipped with the 4.3 Android OS. Love it ! Thanks Amazon ! 1;	0.3	4.0
B00F2SKPIM	5	AWESOME !!! Absolutely the greatest phone on the market. Puts the iphone to shame. My son played with it for 30 minutes and within a week got rid of his iphone and got one of these.

Write a name and a phone #, touch contacts and it's there instantly in your contact list. The 13 MP camera is great. The Smart Touch lets me transfer photos to my wife's phone instantly by just touching the devices together.

B00F2SKPIM	5	Glad I got this! I like the big screen and so many smart features. I've owned iPhone for about 4 years and I got tired of its small screen.

Oh, one important thing that I almost forgot is that you don't need to go through any program like iTune to upload music and photos. You can download directly from computer to the phone. This phone is easier to use than I thought. I like it very much! 1;	0.3	4.6
B00F2SKPIM	5	Best Phone Ever I couldn't have found a better price anywhere. At first, I feared that I was going to get a refurbished phone or a phone that had been slightly used and returned. But I could tell, it was brand-spanking new. Everything worked beautifully, and I haven't had a single problem with it. It was shipped overnight free of charge, and it was packaged very nicely and safe. I get a signal where my friends and family members don't get one.

B00F2SKPIM	5	From a Motorola DX I got this as an upgrade for my wife and she truly loves it. Technology in general is not her cup of tea, however the interface and the vibrant screen helps make the transition a bit smoother. Here is a quick overview on the specs [...] Personally I'm using a Motorola Razr Maxx but when upgrade time comes up I will need to seriously consider this! 1;	0.2	1.7
B00F2SKPIM	5	Love this phone Love this phone, can't complain. If you treat it right and turn off power-hungry settings and it won't die on you. Pen is magical. I take work notes on it, personal notes, grocery lists, and the screen is to die for. If you're on the fence, it's even slim (if you don't use a protector) 1;	0.2	2.6
B00F2SKPIM	5	Love This Phone! Purchased this smart phone for the wife. She absolutely loves it. She says that the screen is very clear, it takes awesome pictures, and it's easy to see. She has a problem with the vision in her right eye, but because of the large display she can easily see the text and pictures. 1;	0.5	3.3
B00F2SKPIM	5	Very good looking and solid phone Very good looking and solid phone. Almost like new. No issues in the first 4 months. Good price. I like it even more than the Note 2 that it replaced. The screen is slightly bigger than the Note 2 screen. 1;	0.3	3.4
B00F2SKPIM	5	Amazing! Wow, I havn;t needed to root, unlock, and install roms at all yet. The stock rom is plenty fast enough for me and the battery life is amazing. I would typically get about one day from my S3 and I get about 2 days from the Note3. 1;	0.5	2.0
B00F2SKPIM	5	I've had a cell phone since 1995 and this is the best phone I have owned Light, sleek, bright, quick. The call quality is good - Better than my old droid max. Antenna seems to be good. I've had this phone for a few weeks and I can't find anything wrong with it. It will run down the battery if you are streaming for hours and playing with it constantly like it did when i first got it. I charge it every night and use it for both work and personal use. 1;	0.4	3.2
B00F2SKPIM	5	Love this Phone! This is the best android phone I've ever had! Love the large display, the pen feature is a real bonus! No more typing with one finger! I can write it out and the phone types it for me! A real time saver! 1;	0.5	4.0

B00F2SKPIM	5	Screw any iPhone 5, 5C, 5S .... There's a new Bad Boy out there called the Note 3. If you are tired of an iPhone (which I'd imagine no one is... sad because the iPhone 4 to the 4S was a bigger leap from the 4S to any of the 5's . . . why? Steve Jobs. Sadly he is gone and apple will never be the same) get the GALAXY NOTE 3!!! Yes it does suck a little because you don't have seamless integration via other Mac products. Guess what? Who cares?! This is a far superior phone and I could go into specs but just read the reviews because I'm too lazy to write them. I had a 4s for two years, then got the 5s and was disappointed to them max!Fix the freakin' aspect ratio you fools. This is the third iPhone 5 and they still fell flat. Pathetic. Truly unacceptable. It's not even 16x9. Why? Yep, no Steve Jobs. This is rudimentary and Apple still doesn't get it. Unacceptable. So I got the Note 3. This baby will blow you away. And if you get a wallet case (Cellto wallet case is awesome) then it is not that bad at all to put up to your ear. It begins to not feel like a tablet (which is beneficial because this pretty much is a tablet too). Amazing Phone. Proud of Samsung for getting it together and delivering! And then some. Love the Pen as I am a filmmaker and just creative :) GET IT!!!! I realize most out there aren't tech save. So have fun with your iPhone. The Galaxy Note 3 combines both worlds. Technicality and user friendliness. Don't believe or don't care? Have fun with an inferior phone. And I love Apple. Always have had both PC and Mac computers. But innovation will never match what Steve Jobs did for Apple. He laid out the blueprints for multiple devices to the world to expand on. I guess Apple didn't get the memo. Clearly. They've reached their pinnacle and can only attempt to catch up to what was already handed to them. Again, pathetic. Disappointing. If you're serious in getting a great phone, buy the Note 3. If not, get whatever the hell you want. It will be inferior. Choose as you will. To each is our own. 1;	0.0	21.4

B00F2SKPIM	5	BEST Phone I Have Ever Owned!! This phone is literally the BEST phone I've ever owned. Samsung really hit it out of the park with this one! The screen in absolutely amazing. Beautiful, bright, and bold! This phone is so fast! That Snapdragon 800 really brings its A game. Everything is buttery smooth and I love it. This phone is a powerhouse and I can barely put it down. It feels great in the hand. Though the screen is bigger, this phone is thinner and lighter than the Note 2. I really didn't think I could love a phone more than my beloved Note 2, but I was wrong! Full HD 1080p takes things to another level. I paid full price for the phone and it was worth EVERY penny. Samsung has won a new fan! 1;	0.5	10.3

B00F9RRVUG	5	Can't beat this little phone for simply talk and text ... Can't beat this little phone for simply talk and text. It's not for the data intensive user. I've had mine for about a year and well as my wife. We're seniors, so this is all the phone we need for our purposes. We're using AT&T as our provider. They're discontinuing 2G service nationwide as of December 2016, so this just might be an inexpensive answer for folks who simply only need talk and text. 1;	0.1	2.5
B00F9RRVUG	5	great value works good im very happy with the value. everyone else pays 100 a month for their service, not me. & when i drop this phone, i laugh, not panic. Go ahead & steal it. I'll replace it with pocket change, not be out 600 bucks to replace & stuck in contract. does everything as advertised. the only negative is feeling like i'm stuck in 2005 tech. but thats not as important to me as the low cost to use & replace if needed. great option for value conscious people. 1;	0.2	4.3
B00F9RRVUG	5	I dont usually review anything... this just for warning Warning! If you plan to unlock this phone like the other reviewer says. Do not do a full reset!

B00F9RRVUG	5	Great phone for travelers This is a great phone for travelers. Once you unlock the phone (see the other Amazon review for unlocking instructions), you can use pre-paid sim cards purchased abroad. I used this phone with an Italian TIM SIM card. The phone is QUAD-band, so it will work globally. Another nice feature is that it charges with a standard micro-USB cable, so you can minimize the # of chargers that you have to carry (very important when backpacking). Overall it's a lightweight, global, reliable and simple phone to use while traveling abroad. Highly recommended! 1;	0.5	4.1

B00F9RRVUG	5	A great replacement for the Junk ZTE GO phone sold in AT&T stores. I had an AT&T Chinese ZTE phone lasted about a year screen went blank and it had horrible battery life. I ordered this Samsung a157v put it on the provided charger removed the battery and popped in the AT&T go phone SIM card phone was up and running in less than two minutes no programming or unlocking needed for an existing go phone customer. My only mistake was the not saving my contact list on the old ZTE to the SIM card so I had to retype in my all my contacts (my error). For a basic GSM phone to make calls and send text this is the phone to have. The Samsung battery life (standby time), voice quality, reception and build quality are all excellent for this price point. I would add this phone is slimmer and lighter weight than the old ZTE. If you are a minimalist and/or a cheapskate like me and you tend to lose, drop, and abuse your phones this is the solution. I plan to buy a spare at this price why not have a backup phone a spare battery and charger ready to go. 1;	0.0	4.0
B00F9RRVUG	5	Great, prompt service I hadn't realized that there is no camera, charger or instruction manual with this item. I've contacted Samsung for a copy of the manual and they say the product is not one of theirs made in the US. Can you help me? 1;	0.2	1.2
B00F9RRVUG	5	Great phone for $15 I bought this phone for my daughter. She is using it on a friend's AT&T family call plan - she said she put her sim card in the phone and was making calls within minutes. Calls are crystal clear. Great buy. 1;	0.5	2.8

B00FJ8YCZM	5	Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Great battery life, large screen, easy to use and set up. This is a must have for those that need to create notes to themselves on the fly. The great thing about the notes are the fact that you can email, text, etc., the information in your own handwriting. Lots of storage space and only seems bulky when the case is on. A slim, sleek phone that will help any business person on the go. Love the access to the camera from the lock screen. If in the market for a phone, this is one that should be considered. 1;	0.5	4.3
B00FJ8YCZM	5	Couldn't be happier I love this phone. I thought I would have issues with how big the screen is, but once you start using it everything else seems small by comparison. The applications run lightning fast and the functionality is mind-blowing. You can really customize it to do and be anything you want. I feel like I got a great deal buying through Amazon, even at the Sprint store they were charging at least $200 for this model. I seriously feel like I have a tiny laptop or tablet with all the power they packed into this phone. The only downsides are the fragility of the phone (looks one unfortunate drop away from being a paperweight), the pre-installed bloatware apps (some are useful and some not, but it comes with A TON), and the battery life (I'm usually around 20% at the end of my work day). In this case, though, the awesome power and coolness of the phone make it more than worth it. 1;	0.4	4.6
B00FJ8YCZM	5	Galaxy Note 3 I love this phone! Pro's: -Battery lasts for 12 hours before next charge unless you are running a lot of apps all the time. -Fell in a puddle twice and stopped working but once I blow dried it (very low heat) and left it open for 24 hours, it restarted! -I have more control over what functions I would like working or not (ex: can turn off that annoying flash for alerts). Con's: -If you have a small hand, its hard to hold. -Their are not many options for cases unless you purchase an Otherbox (spelling?) but that's too bulky to carry around. 1;	0.0	2.7

B00FJ8YCZM	5	I love this phone so far and I haven't even used it yet! I just received my Galaxy Note 3 today. Although I have not set up service with my carrier yet, I had to voice my opinion on how well and secure it was packaged. Not to mention I thought the wood style paper box had a sexy design (I will save it for display in my boutique looking closet). I wanted this phone more than any phone I have ever had (Note: I am not a high tech cell phone fan), but this one was a must have. After careful researching and reading as many reviews as possible on this phone, I decided to order it on Monday. The price was more than excellent, so far no regrets. Everyone had it for well over $300 Did I pay that? Nope! I will update status of usage and quality on the review board once I experience it for a while. So!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Happy. 1;	0.3	6.0

The phone works great, looks even better than the first one I bought, and I haven't had any issues with it.) Protecting my investment with a ballistic case that should arrive any day now.

B00HWENIUG	5	The Best Windows Phone on Verizon If you are a fan of Windows Phone then you probably know that Nokia makes some of the best out. That trend continues with the Lumia Icon with a great industrial design and hardware to rival the best phones on any platform. If you don't mind a 5 inches phone and I think that's the sweet spot for a large screen phone. You get great camera for photo and video and the only real drawback is that Windows Phone doesn't always get the apps like iOS and Android. Get past that which is starting to change and you have a great top of the line phone with all the specs for a great experience. 1;	0.6	4.1

B00I2KY6LE	5	I was totally satisfied with the item I bought this phone from the Magic Mobile Partners. I was totally satisfied with the item. Brand new in its sealed original retail box as advertised. The phone itself is very good, especially for its outstanding Carl Zeiss camera. Updated to Windows mobile 8.1 with no problem. I completed all the settings and it now can work well under T-Mobile 3g net work (including MMS). However, due to some unknown reason, although it has no problem to receive sms, it cannot send sms under T-Mobile 3g.It is OK under 2g network. So I have to manually switch it to T-Mobile 2g network each time when I send sms. Anyway, with this low price, I should not expect more. I give it 5 stars. 1;	0.3	5.0

B00K0NS0P4	5	Great pocket-size phone that works with Net10 I've owned this phone (XT1045 / Peregrine) for more than three years and still really like it. I've only relegated it to backup status because of limited internal storage (only 8 GB). Still it's great for travel, and in terms of speed it's the equal of my newer, larger primary phone. Those who like to tinker with their phones by rooting and upgrading to alternate ROMs will appreciate that this Moto G still has an active community of developers on the XDA website, where you can upgrade your Android OS months (years?) before Motorola gets around to sending it to you. It also works flawlessly with Net10, which runs on the AT&T network. 1;	0.5	3.5
B00KHY09BE	5	Thank you for this great phone great price Thank you for this great phone great price. Been wanting to get a decent phone. For a while great shape for a used phone screen is awesome it is a littler bigger than my old ruby pro doesn't fit in my carpenter jean pocket lol that's my problem phone is great so far . I've always had good luck with Samsung phones only other weird thing is the camera lens come out of the body they should have made extended corners to keep the phone from sitting on the cement on its back but the glass is replaceable if anything happens to the lense so no biggy at all. loving the camo general don't care about that kinda stuff but it is cool especially for the die hard camo people lol the type of person that probably would by this kind of phone out door and it is mil spec supposedly right so Ya cool stuff. phones have come a long ways this is pretty much a computer that u can call people on lol.

B00KHY09BE	5	Absolutely satisfied with the phone and the seller service Purchased this used phone through VeritasCellular. Absolutely satisfied with the phone and the seller service. The description of the phone was spot on (excellent), with only a few minor scratches on the back, it looks like new, with no wear spots. I spent the day going through all the menus to make sure everything works. This phone replaced a Iphone 5S, I found it frustrating at times to operate, the Android menus are easier and faster to navigate. Since I travel in areas where internet service is nearly non existent, speaking a text message or phone number while driving is sometimes necessary for me, but apparently Siri needs an internet connection to work. Love the Galaxy S5, and thank you Veritascellular. 1;	0.4	4.6
B00KHY09BE	5	and has been working fine for the two months I've had it Bought this phone after my Galaxy S6 Active suddenly died on me in January. Arrived quickly, and has been working fine for the two months I've had it. Slightly annoying that whenever I unplug it from a charger it gives me a pop-up reminding me to make sure the charger port cover is sealed, but I think that's just the model in general not the seller or anything. Can run everything my S6 ran as well, though it's a little slow to load some larger apps like Pokémon GO. 1;	0.0	1.9

B00KHY09BE	5	I do want to mention that I am very pleased with the active I have, admittedly, had the Galaxy S for 6 years before purchasing the S5 Active; so I won't go into much detail about how blown away I am. I do want to mention that I am very pleased with the active; the standard feels cheap by comparison. The mechanical menu, home and back button take a few days to get used to. I wasnt certain i liked them at first, but I am now very fond of them. I don't use the active button much, but it's useful for whipping out the flashlight (which is fantastic, btw.) 1;	0.6	3.1

B00KHY09BE	5	I am in love with this phone! I love this phone, I bought it four months ago, after I was sick of having to delete so much of my stuff to save storage on my iPhone 5 that I was using. What can I say, at half the price of a phone I bought years ago, I am so pleased! The display and color are beautiful, the back camera and even the front camera are great, I love how much storage is already on it and that you can add as much as you want. With as much as I use my phone, the battery lasts from the time I wake up until I go to bed, and this phone is pretty darn durable too. I have a glass screen protector and a clear silicone case, and my phone hasn't gotten any scratches or dings on it in four months! The only complaint I have about this phone is that it overheats, but I take care of that using a cleaner app (which resolves the issue pretty well). This phone is definitely worth it! 1;	0.6	6.0

It was listed as \""\""good-used\""\"" but it may as well have been new. No scratches or scuffs that I could discern (especially on the screen) and it works like a charm. The charging port cover hinge broke after only a month but I believe that is a design defect from Samsung and I won't hold it against this seller. The phone got to me quickly and the phone itself was better than advertised by the seller. I still love my \""\""new\""\"" Galaxy S5 Active and would highly recommend the seller. I did a lot of research on the product so I knew exactly what I was getting so this review is primarily focused on the seller.\"" 1;"""	0.3	5.7

B00L4DXRS4	5	Great little phone This Nokia phone is lightweight, has great call quality, and has a removable battery (something you don't find in smartphones these days), and a micro sd card slot. I love how the phone lasts over 3 weeks on a single charge on light-moderate usage. It comes with 3.5mm earphones and they have a microphone. Overall, I really enjoy this phone but the only downside is that I couldn't find a setting to turn the brightness down but other than that it's a very good phone. 1;	0.5	2.6
B00L4DXRS4	5	Great phone for your non-smartphone needs. 35 bucks! Just got mine in the mail today and I love it. Get a mini sd card for your storage needs and you're in business (the phone itself has very little storage). The trickiest part is setting up MMS so you can send/receive pictures, but it can be done.

B00LAEA8E8	5	Great phone, low price. Posted this mid 2018. 2 of my sisters, my wife, & I are all using the S5. It's fast enough, and supports current apps. Unlike some newer phones, it has a micro SD slot - Saves $ & allows me to upgrade.when larger chips become available. I'm on my 2nd S5, and no reason to replace it. This cost me about 6% of what an S8 was going to cost from our cell service provider. I don't use a cover, or have insurance on it, because it's relatively cheap to replace. The unprotected screen has yet to get a scratch in it (I do machine shop work, & build/repair things at home). My wife uses a cover, My daughter uses an S7 because it has a better camera, but I'm fine with the S5's. I'm much happier carrying a phone that I don't have to obsess over. 1;	0.2	4.7

Take your time upgrading system updates don't overheat your new phone.I lost track of the number of updates probably six or more times the phone will update, At first I thought it was reinstalling the same updates,don't worry just keep going. Pay attention to the date on the security patch updates. At this time June 3, 2017 your last Android security patch level should be April 1,2017. Go to settings scroll down to \""\""about phone\""\"" to find update info. Good Luck. The charging port cover did break off. Phone will give you a message that cover is not closed.

B00LAEA8E8	5	From a user of a 15 year OLD phone, taking the plunge into NEW tech..... Finally took the plunge & upgraded phone & service plan after 15 years....and I am BLOWN AWAY at the incredible reception in my area- almost all my friends & service people that come to the house get ZERO reception...and while I certainly can't pull in 4G in my area, at least I can GET calls now & haven't had them drop or garble as before. Being able to connect to WiFi is certainly a plus & provides excellent reception if the cellular connection is not strong...which, on certain days, depending upon the weather, happens. So far, this phone is everything I expected & more. Configuring has been fairly easy, but I am familiar with Android OS, so that helps. Still learning the ins & outs of the actual phone & text features, but again, everything has been fairly easy to do. I actually took this down to the local Verizon store & had them do the SIM installation & activation since I was clueless, so THAT was SUPER easy! Screen is AWESOME, colors/display incredible, & so far, I LOVE this phone....hopefully it will continue!! Will post updates as I use the phone more (if I remember, LOL) 1;	0.4	5.2

B00N532C1E	5	Great phone for its size! I LOVE THIS PHONE!!! This was a huge upgrade from the SIII. Even though this phone has a smaller battery than the other galaxy phones, I can still last a whole day without having to recharge it. The display is great. My favorite thing about it is its size! I love how I can have a Samsung Galaxy phone that is not as big as the S5 and S6! There are a few cons. The front facing camera is ok, considering that it is a 2.1 megapixel camera. Also, you can't insert an SD card in order to increase its memory. But you really don't need one as it is a 32GB phone. Another thing is that there are some features that are present in the S5 and S6, such as some of the camera features. Overall, this is a great phone to have if you are looking to have a Samsung Galaxy phone with the latest updates but in a smaller size and a lower price. Don't let the cons outweigh the pros of having this phone. 1;	0.3	7.1

B00NACK1DG	5	I enjoy this phone very much I enjoy this phone very much. I purchased it to function as my everyday computer, and with the bluetooth keyboard and mouse I purchased for it, it will do great as just that. It is compatible with OTG and MHL. I have large hands, and so holding it isn't a problem, although, of course, with such a large phone, reaching the top of the screen with your thumb is never easy. I'm purchasing an iRing knockoff (and securing it with the built in anchor point as a fail-safe) in order to make it easier to hold, support the phone as a stand, and also give me a place to put a carabiner to clip it onto my jeans. That is my only real complaint, that it is so hard to find a case that you can be sure will work for it, and even if you do, the case is just hanging around empty while you use your phone; my three-in-one solution then was an iRing and a carabiner. An extra complaint for AT&T though related to this phone is that you will not be able to easily update it to 4.4.2 unless you have an AT&T sim card. The only way to do it otherwise is to use a program called Odin to manually install the update: http://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-mega/general/stock-odin-firmware-i527-4-4-2-t2835136 (this will erase all of your data). To get the phone into download mode it is volume down (not up) + power + home all at the same time. I purchased this product used but the only problems were that the screen has damage so that a dark purple spot appears in the lower left corner of the screen rather than black and the case is slightly bent at the top. I do have to say though that the carrying case sent with it in no way fits the phone; it does, however, fit the pico projector that I purchased to go with the phone. 1;	0.2	3.8

B00NFG57CW	5	great window phone This phone is amazing I love it! It has a really smooth a interface. I I prefer it over Android and Apple phones. It has a great 11 mega pixel camera with lots of options you can mess with to get the perfect shot. Great call quality and yes it work great with straight talk! Only con it dose not have that many apps 1;	0.5	4.6
B00NFG57CW	5	Exactly what I expected, without all the extra software It's a great phone. I've always liked Nokia (Now Microsoft) products, and as usual, this device is solidly built. Note that the phone is built for the international market so it comes with none of the additional software that is loaded on the handset that comes from AT&T or Verizon as branding. Yes, apps are still a little sparse on Windows phones, but that is improving. 1;	0.5	2.6
B00NFG57CW	5	Great phone Good quality, doesn't feel cheap rather premium. I upgraded it with no problems to Windows 10 and it works great. 1;	0.6	1.9
B00NFG57CW	5	Update to 5-stars Although the phone was flawless, I read so many different web write-ups that I mistakenly read this one as unlocked. Then I dinged them for it. Not cool on my part. 1;	0.0	0.8
B00NFG57CW	5	Solid phone worth considering This is a great upgrade for me. Pros: You can add up to a 128 mini SD card giving you memory for music, pictures and video Fast and responsive phone for everything I've used Nice camera makes for some crisp pictures and great for video apps like Skype Cons: No LTE with T-Mobile but I knew that going in 1;	0.9	1.9

B00NFG57CW	5	Love my Lumia 830 Switching from iPhone it was definitely a little weird at the beginning and took some time to get used to (even as a Surface tablet user) but after a few weeks with the Lumia I just love it more. Definite highlights for me are the camera (took so many good vacation pictures that you would think I had a professional camera with me, yeah the camera is that good in my opinion), the Here drive + offline navigation (takes quite a lot of battery but definitely saved me a few times from getting lost while on vacation and not having internet), the screen (very good resolution and sensitive touch screen, reacts so much better than my old iPhone) and the camera (oh yeah the camera's so good it deserves to be mentioned twice. As someone that doesn't have a real camera and takes all picture with the phone I'm just baffled that I can take pictures with that quality with my phone now). Known flaw is the windows app store, but I could find all the important apps for me, which are not a lot because I really just use my phone for text, calls, the occasional google search or email and then of course for music and as a camera. All that works great and with a 64 GB SD card there is enough storage for all my music and pictures. I have a Surface tablet for work and a Kindle for reading so I don't expect my phone to do what my tablet can or have the battery time from my kindle, I just expect it to work and that's what it does and it does it smooth and without any problems. Battery lasts 2 days with regular use (even 3 with less use), which I consider as being remarkable for a phone with all the features that the Lumia has. I wanted a good and fast phone for not too much money with a very good camera and that is exactly what I got and I really do love it. 1;	0.4	6.6
B00NKR9MJA	5	This Galaxy note 4 is a great replacement phone! This phone is a great value with all the bells and whistles I love about the notes. I've had the note 2, 3 and now the 4, it just gets faster, more features, more memory and better cameras. The particular one I got only charges up to 77 percent with the stock battery, but it's refurbished so not unexpected. I ordered a new genuine note 4 adaptive rapid charge capable battery inexpensively through Amazon, and now it's fine, it's a great value for the price. 1;	0.5	4.1

Still have my old red droid but mic is a bit messed. This blue droids battery doesn’t last the 2 and a half days like my old red but it’s definitely better than the othe phones ive purchased like the samsung 6 edge, and especially the 7. I have 7 email accounts on cell, several apps, using wifi at times but mostly my mobile network, it stands strong on the battery life considering i use it during work to help guests.

B00OZTSY6Y	5	Best Smartphone Ever - New, As Described TalkTime sent me a brand new factory sealed Verizon phone as described very quickly with the free shipping option. It was much pricier than I wanted to pay, but my old one lasted 3 or 4 years and was the best smartphone I'd ever had and really the only one I could stand, so when the phone started to think the battery was dead and turn off at 52% charge consistently, I really wanted to get the same phone. I couldn't find a new one anywhere since they stopped making it and all the new phones I'd have to sacrifice half the battery life and half the camera megapixel if I want to stay with Verizon, so I felt this was worth the splurge to not use my upgrade through my contract. I don't know if I'm imagining it or the battery isn't lasting quite as long as the old one that could go a full day or two with constant use, but I have only used it to download and update apps and set up settings for many hours straight, so that might have been what did it. I like that I can take a picture and then crop a small section and still have a high quality photo with the 21 megapixel camera. I never zoom in on pictures though because I find the quality isn't as great. The battery really does last a lot longer than any other phone, so I never have to carry a portable charger and that was the main draw of this phone. 1;	0.0	3.5

B00OZTSY6Y	5	Longer & healthier relationship with this phone than my ex husband Two and a half years later and this phone still does well enough that I have no interest in any of the reasonably priced options on the market. Never had to have it serviced and the only real problem I've ever had is it outliving chargers and occasionally needing to bonk it at the base when the orientation sensor gets stuck. Battery life is still good, does 99% of what I need and with a case & screen cover consistently on - it looks as good as when I got it. 1;	0.4	1.9
B00OZTSY6Y	5	My favorite phone so far My favorite phone so far. Finally can go ~2 days on a charge. Between turbo charge and long battery life. I almost never charge over night anymore because I do not need to, which would leave the phone plugged in for hours at 100% charge - that can be bad for the battery. The OS on this Droid Turbo is the first time I have not rooted and installed a custom rom within minutes of getting an android phone.

B00U8F1F1A	5	Good seller. I bought this item and this was the first out of three sellers that got my order correct. I ordered the XT1103 CDMA North American version. Not only did it come on time, but the phone was brand new in factory sealed packaging. I would definitely buy from them again. The phone is in mint condition and works perfectly. I have not rooted it yet but know that there is battery life issues on Oreo. This phone only goes up to 7.1 on ota updates. Still the best phone ever made and continually kicks the crap out of every other phone on - or off the market. The Pixel XL may be faster but, I am not interested in dropping 800 bucks for bloat- ware and carrier provisioning. Currently running Verizon 4G LTE and Google Fi LTE with no issues. I rooted one the XT1100's and am using it as a mobile hotspot on Verizon. The world versions get data but no voice or IMS. Make sure to get an 1103 for Verizon or TMobile. 1;	0.0	4.8

Don't get me wrong the iPhone 6s is a great phone it's just that samsung has outdone apple this time with a 2k screen (Quad hd) better camrea and almost all spec's are better **Update had this phone for about 4-5 months now still working great just take good care of your phone and it'll last a lifetime 1;	0.9	1.8

B00UA8JZA8	5	Really liked this phone but the warranty is handled by Malaysia Really liked this phone but the warranty is handled by Malaysia. Wish I would have known that before I purchased it.

B00UA8JZA8	5	Got it as a gift, and it shipped in reasonable time. Phone was in great condition, and recipient is happy. The phone is happily being used by the recipent as a gift.

B00UA8JZA8	5	Amazing Phone for an Amazing Price Amazing Phone. The Samsung Galaxy S6 Pops out at you once you open it from the box. From an easy set up, to a fantastic android synchronization, this phone does it all. Camera has AMAZING QUALITY. Fingerprint Sensor. Everything the Iphone 6s+ has, but even more with higher quality and more features than the Iphone can possibly accomplish. This phone comes with Microsoft word, excel, powerpoint. It can record in Ultra HD. It can record in slow motion. It can fly, and it can order you pizza to fly and get it for you. Please purchase this or the S7. The Edge version has the same specs but is weather/terrain/shock resistant. 1;	0.2	4.8

B00V7FWEX8	5	Phone is near perfect, performance perfect thus far, seller pretty fair but could improve. Near perfect cosmetic condition, and so far the performance is great, too. Although the charger that came with it is for an LG phone, that's no big deal.. but issue is that it was too low amperage to charge the phone while in use. Luckily I have a spare Samsung charger. Also, the IMEI on the box did not match the IMEI of the phone, and after figuring this out and an hour on the phone with Sprint and Boost, we were able to get the phone switched to my Boost account and activated. So, I dinged the seller a couple stars for those issues, but otherwise they're great, and the phone itself I gave 5 stars becasue it's way better than I expected for a refurb. Though I have only had it for a few hours, so if it starts geeking out, I'll update accordingly. 1;	0.4	4.2

B00V7FWWA8	5	THE PLANET'S NUMBER ONE MOBILE PHONE ACCORDING TO THIS CUSTOMER... Well Samsung, just when the world thought you could not make a better mouse trap, you took the mouse and redesigned it. What an amazingly outstanding phone. The superior quality is unsurpassed by ANY OTHER MOBILE PHONE MAKER.. The 128GB of internal memory plus the cloud based holder of all my photos. videos, music and data is outstanding as well.... I could not be happier and everything from the wireless charging to the ALWAYS punctual shipping and dealing with Amazon and it's high quality customer service reps. Well this was a shopping experience I have not had in an very long time. The excellent price of $914.00 was totally awesome and now with the continued Cricket service I have had for 15 years, well I have a phone that others are envying...

My husband is very hard on phones and these have always taken a good beating and mostly survived. A dive into a bucket of kerosene killed one (although it sort of functioned for awhile). A 2-story drop onto rock killed another. One survived an excavator driving over it (not sure how). The other plus is that you can make the fonts really big which is what older folks out in the field really like. No fumbling for glasses just to see what time it is or who is calling. 1;	0.2	4.4

I'm very satisfied with the customer service and the final product. Trustworthy seller, I would purchase from them again. 👍👍 1;	0.2	4.1

As an example, I had a couple issues with the phones that did require some attention, yet every time I called or wrote, they were patient as if it was the first time. They provided customer service that is probably the best that I have seen in a while. As a result I have good phones and good phone service. Thanks! 1;	0.5	4.1

After inserting my Tmobile sim card phone is working as expected. A notification did popped up stating \""\""sim card to from Verizon\""\"" but I was able to disable it so it won't keep popping up. It may take some time for the phone to receive incoming calls. Mine started working within about 45 minutes after inserting Sim card. Some usere may have to update the APN settings which is what allows you to access mobile data and picture messaging. This can be done easily with a quick google search or contact your carrier to walk you through it.\"" 1;"""	0.2	2.3

B00ZE8HRYK	5	"This is my second S6 Active! \My previous S6 Active was over three years old and was working great. No problems with performance of any kind. Good battery life. Beautiful display. Even though I never used a case, there was so little wear or cosmetic damage that you really had to look carefully to find any. In February, I traveled by air, and the battery swelled up, bulging out the back of the phone. Bad news. I started looking at newer Active phones, and found them discouraging. They seemed like downgrades. Expensive ones. I wished that AT&T still sold the S6 Active. Then I broadened my search and found them here. I'm very happy to have my \""\""old\""\"" phone back  and for much less than I would have paid for the latest model. The battery life is a little better now. It took me about a week to get through all of the OS updates;"""	0.0	8.2

B010V43VFA	5	Holy Moly THIS phone. This phone just blows your other phones out of the water. It quite literally is the best phone out there. If you buy itbrand new, international, Amazon is kind enough to include an adapter for the phone for wherever they are shipping the device to. The phone, brand new takesa few updates that'll take take around 3 hours to finish, but once you're done, it's Marshmallow(latest Android update) heaven baby. The phone, despite being a last generation Xperia Device can take anything you throw at it. Any app, any game, it'll heat up to a point, but not enough to shut it down or damage the device. Heat is only natural for these devices as there are no other ways to disperse the heat besides the built in heat sinks. And the heat is not a bad thing, that just means your phone is doing work. I give this phone a 5/5 for now let's wait for the upcoming weeks. 1;	0.0	3.7

Note: the first two times I charged the phone the battery indicator indicated 0% charge the next morning. The third charge was the charm and has been fine ever since. Also, the shipping was much, much quicker then the seller indicated. I would think that might cost him some sales from folks in a hurry.

B0134TVCHI	5	Really is a great phone. Received my S6 Edge Plus today and I'm already in aw of it. It's Brand New and works like a dream. I switched from my old phone which was a Note 4 (That I loved btw) that I hated to get rid of but do to some issues with it freezing, not turning on and etc.. I had to buy a new one which lead me on a world wide interweb search to find a phone that wasn't so different from the Note 4 (Since I hate any change when I'm used to something) so I actually ended up getting a Note 5 first and that phone turned out to have a faulty signal and it just had problems. Leave it to me to find the bad egg lol. So I decided to get the original phone that I had wanted in the first place which was the S6 Edge Plus. I'm happy to say I don't regret my choice of ordering this Phone. The only thing I do regret is not ordering the phone case,and screen protector for it since I don't plan on returning this phone any time soon. One last thing the screen size is huge. compared next to my note 4 they are pretty much the same size which I love. 1;	0.1	6.1

B013XAPPIK	5	exactly what i needed I replaced my old s5. it was just to old and I could not clean it up anymore and it was dropping calls left and right. I got the note 5, and I am happy with it besides my service. nothing to do with the phone itself. I needed it and the seller gave a perfect description, it only has one scratch on it and that was totally acceptable they rated it in good condition and it was. it works smoothly, has way more storage and enough ram to get anything I need to do. I can put all my apps back on it that I use for travel, shopping, and social media. I am new to s pen, I find I want to use keyboard often. all in all I am pleased and I will be buying a note again. 1;	0.3	6.2
B013XAPPIK	5	Happy customer This would be a first smartphone with a stylus for my mom. She likes my Note 4 and all that I do with it. The UI was simple and the tutorials and customization features were a big selling point since she just started her business. The Samsung and Android apps come in handy being able to sync things from phone to tablet or laptop. Nice size screen and the phone isn't too big to hold for either. She is very happy with the phone and how easy it is to use for personal and business matters. 1;	0.6	4.5
B013XAPPIK	5	Still a relevant smartphone. I get a new phone every year and without hesitation this is the best phone I have ever owned. Screen is awesome and big, but the phone itself is not too large. Camera takes excellent photos. Speaker and mic work very well. This phone was recently upgraded to Android 7.0,which runs flawlessly. The new version of the Samsung UI is also slick and feature rich. My favorite feature is the physical home button /fingerprint reader. This makes the phone so much more convenient to unlock. How did I ever live without it? 1;	0.6	7.5
B013XAPPIK	5	Happy purchase, not a paid review. Bought this from Topshop direct. Details were used like new, in box. The only thing wrong with it was a few peck marks on the screen, but after installing a screen protector you can't even see them at all. It is GSM unlocked, not bootloader unlocked (att). Phone works great with no problems. Do not like--nonremovable battery, no sd card slot, surely a Samsung goof up. Good purchase, definitely satisfied. 1;	0.1	4.0

No SIM card, no activating. Apparently, unlocked phones, in general don't come with SIM cards. Now, I'm trying to find where you can buy one that will be compatible with the Note 5, 32GB (Sprint). I've been told Sprint will send one to me for free, so I really hope that's true (I already have an account with them...trying to replace the old phone with this one). I'll leave another review if/when I can get the SIM card. **UPDATE 12/6** I was able to get a new SIM card from Sprint for free, & it arrived the next day. I LOVE this phone. I have had no issues. I had originally purchased the Note 7 through Sprint back in August, then the first recall happened. I received a replacement device, only have that one recalled as well. I was really disappointed, but have been very happy with the Note 5. I have yet to discover the difference from the Note 7, which makes me very happy. 1;	0.1	7.4

B013XAPPIK	5	Great Phone, Near New Condition Absolutely love this phone. It was a long over due upgrade from my old Motorola Droid Mini, and feels new in every way. Love the size of the screen and everything about how well the phone runs. This particular phone was used of course, but shows almost no sign of it. No marks on the screen, just a couple Tiny scuffs on the physical Homes button. Phone is great aside from that. No software or hardware issues so far, a couple weeks in from purchase now. I do wish the Note 5 had expandable storage, but that's not the seller's fault of course. 1;	0.1	4.2
B013XAPPIK	5	Great refurbished phone! Still great in 2018 Exactly as described. The only cosmetic imperfections were from someone that had a screen protector and in the high use fingerprint reader. You still had to look hard to find it. Everything works great out the box. I'm on cricket so all I had to do was put in my sim card. This is awesome phone that is still great in 2018 1;	0.5	4.5
B013XAPPIK	5	I like my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 a bunch. This phone will prpbably not explode in your pocket and I really like mine a lot. Fast, light and stylish. Lack of an additional SD card storage slot is a negative. Only really minor issue is with the fingerprint unlock function which is more of a software problem. 1;	0.2	3.0

B013XAPPIK	5	Samsung hits its stride... One of the best phones ever made. From the screen to the battery life, so much of this phone is exceptional. However, its software leaves something to be desired unless if you've always had a Samsung phone. Android purists need not apply. Also, the speaker is pretty weak, but aside from that this is one of the best Android phones on the market. Not much different from the Note 7. 1;	0.2	3.7

B014Z8HDWU	5	"BuySpry seems to be great \Editing the review shown below: I still stand my my statement that I bought the phone through BuySpry. They might be better than other sellers. I have no comparison. I've had this iPhone for a few weeks now and my wife is happy with it - so I am happy with it. As far as I can tell, it is working well. I can say that it is working better than the iPhone 6 I bought new years ago (of course a \""\""new\""\"" phone should work better than a phone that has seen a lot of use.) ============================= I bought the iPhone 6 through BuySpry. It is in nearly pristine condition and battery health is at 100%. I have only had it for a few days and need more time for a better evaluation - more to come at a future time. I've seen a lot of negative reviews  especially regarding the battery. Maybe BuySpry is a superior reseller. I also purchased the extended warranty thinking that this would be useful if there is an issue.\"";"""	0.2	3.7

I have noticed some issues but they are minor, my self facing camera seems to have developed some weird white spots and I've attempted to clean the lens but they remain, they are not always noticeable though so I am not bothered. The fingerprint reader is terrible but not something I bother with anyway so again for me it was no big deal, I got it to work a few times but most of the time it took more time to unlock through that method than the PIN. 1;	0.0	1.6

B015FZLA8A	5	Great phone - low battery life tho. A phone you don't have to lease and same hardware as most 700 dollar phones. I'm not a droid user since version 1 and 2, but for the cost its fun to experiment with ROMS. And the company doesn't jerk you on rooting your phone. I like the phone allot and I am also a iPhone user. One plus is now on my favorite list of Droid phones, a low cost , but high quality components. The battery should be removable tho. 1;	0.2	3.6

B018OMP8ES	5	exactly what i needed I replaced my old s5. it was just to old and I could not clean it up anymore and it was dropping calls left and right. I got the note 5, and I am happy with it besides my service. nothing to do with the phone itself. I needed it and the seller gave a perfect description, it only has one scratch on it and that was totally acceptable they rated it in good condition and it was. it works smoothly, has way more storage and enough ram to get anything I need to do. I can put all my apps back on it that I use for travel, shopping, and social media. I am new to s pen, I find I want to use keyboard often. all in all I am pleased and I will be buying a note again. 1;	0.3	6.2
B018OMP8ES	5	Happy customer This would be a first smartphone with a stylus for my mom. She likes my Note 4 and all that I do with it. The UI was simple and the tutorials and customization features were a big selling point since she just started her business. The Samsung and Android apps come in handy being able to sync things from phone to tablet or laptop. Nice size screen and the phone isn't too big to hold for either. She is very happy with the phone and how easy it is to use for personal and business matters. 1;	0.6	4.5
B018OMP8ES	5	Still a relevant smartphone. I get a new phone every year and without hesitation this is the best phone I have ever owned. Screen is awesome and big, but the phone itself is not too large. Camera takes excellent photos. Speaker and mic work very well. This phone was recently upgraded to Android 7.0,which runs flawlessly. The new version of the Samsung UI is also slick and feature rich. My favorite feature is the physical home button /fingerprint reader. This makes the phone so much more convenient to unlock. How did I ever live without it? 1;	0.6	7.5
B018OMP8ES	5	Happy purchase, not a paid review. Bought this from Topshop direct. Details were used like new, in box. The only thing wrong with it was a few peck marks on the screen, but after installing a screen protector you can't even see them at all. It is GSM unlocked, not bootloader unlocked (att). Phone works great with no problems. Do not like--nonremovable battery, no sd card slot, surely a Samsung goof up. Good purchase, definitely satisfied. 1;	0.1	4.0
B018OMP8ES	5	Awesome buy Product works great came in better condition then posted ive had this phone for some months and havent had a problem yet wish battery lasted longer but i think thats the case with any phone would suggest buying a portable charger to use while your not close to a plug in. 1;	0.5	1.0
B018OMP8ES	5	Note 5 is awesome! Great phone. Strong battery. The VR applications work flawlessly. Phone is perfect size, no slippery sides like my old LG. Samsung is the best. Oh yeah... the stylus is excellent! Very reactive and precise touch. Like a pen and paper. 1;	0.6	6.7
B018OMP8ES	5	One of the best phones you'll find. Great seller. Awesome phone, the Samsung notes have always been great phones. I had one then bought the note 7, it was then recalled so I had to go this to a note 5. It arrived in slightly worse condition than described, mostly cosmetic. They sent me some new items to make up for it. I'm 100% satisfied. Thank you 1;	0.4	4.0
B018OMP8ES	5	Love this phone! I got this to replace my despised iPhone. It is everything I wanted and more. Lots of storage, takes good pictures, runs all my favorite apps, and is super easy to set up and use. I love the note feature and the attached S-pen. The ability to write and save a note without even unlocking the phone is very convenient. I'm so glad I ditched Apple and went back to Samsung! 1;	0.5	4.8

B018OMP8ES	5	Perfect condition as advertised. I bought this as a phone waiting in the wings since Samsung is not making Note 5 phones any longer. This phone came in a different color much to my delight. The color doesn't matter since I keep my phones in a case but I like the black much better than the gold it was supposed to be. The phone booted fine. I have not set it up yet but the splash screen said verizon just like it should have and then went to the setup screen.

B018OMP8ES	5	The good: the phone arrived in 2 days as promised The good: the phone arrived in 2 days as promised. It looks great, etc. The bad: this phone does not come with a SIM card. No SIM card, no activating. Apparently, unlocked phones, in general don't come with SIM cards. Now, I'm trying to find where you can buy one that will be compatible with the Note 5, 32GB (Sprint). I've been told Sprint will send one to me for free, so I really hope that's true (I already have an account with them...trying to replace the old phone with this one). I'll leave another review if/when I can get the SIM card. **UPDATE 12/6** I was able to get a new SIM card from Sprint for free, & it arrived the next day. I LOVE this phone. I have had no issues. I had originally purchased the Note 7 through Sprint back in August, then the first recall happened. I received a replacement device, only have that one recalled as well. I was really disappointed, but have been very happy with the Note 5. I have yet to discover the difference from the Note 7, which makes me very happy. 1;	0.1	7.4

Love the size of the screen and everything about how well the phone runs. This particular phone was used of course, but shows almost no sign of it. No marks on the screen, just a couple Tiny scuffs on the physical Homes button. Phone is great aside from that. No software or hardware issues so far, a couple weeks in from purchase now.

B018OMP8ES	5	Great refurbished phone! Still great in 2018 Exactly as described. The only cosmetic imperfections were from someone that had a screen protector and in the high use fingerprint reader.

B0192TCZWA	5	STILL ONE OF THE BEST RUGGED SMARTPHONES This Smartphone may be a bit old and outdated by today's technology, but it's still one of the best rugged smartphone's out there today that is within a budget friendly price. Your basically getting about a 2-3 year old flagship Smartphone for the budget and price of a budget smartphone. My only complaints and really it's just me, is that the battery drains pretty fast and the phone itself does tend to get really hot when charging using the turbo charger, and when the battery starts to get closer to dying. Also, I wish the backlight would be a bit better because even on it's brightest setting it still looks dim. Other than these, it's perfect. And the being really hot when charging can be solved by just putting an OtterBox deffender case on it and presto! No more burning hot hands. 1;	0.4	3.7

B01CJ3SCCI	5	However after hearing such great things about the Galaxy S7 Edge I've been with Apple since the iPhone 4 until the iPhone 6. However after hearing such great things about the Galaxy S7 Edge, I decided to make it my next new phone. This phone is absolutely incredible. It works fantastic, it's quick, customizable, and the camera is incredible. The phone itself looks awesome and is super thin and very sleek. I plan on using this and white knows if I'll go back to Apple now 1;	0.5	3.6
B01CJ3SCCI	5	So Far So Good OK, a tentative 5 star rating as I have only had the product for a few hours. I have to say that so far I am impressed. First of all the phone was on my doorstep within 2 days of ordering, I chose standard free shipping and was not expecting the phone for another 4 days.The phone does not show any appearance of being used, and looks to be a new S7 Edge. The change over from my existing S5 was easy as well, although it did require a trip to my local Verizon store to get a nano sim card (the old card does not work). This did cost me $10, but I am ok with that, the whole process took less than 15 minutes for the new card. This can also be done online with Verizon, but I am too impatient to wait a few days for the new sim card. 1;	0.1	2.9
B01CJ3SCJ6	5	Great phone. I really love this phone over my old Galaxy S4 that was starting to have issues. I took it to Verizon got a new sim card and I was off and running. It needed some security updates and such, and only once during a security update did I have it plugged in that it got really hot. For the most part everything else has been great. Since I got it refurbished I didn't have the tool to get into the phone to add the microsd card and sim card, but I had a really small jewelers screwdriver that did the trick. I noticed that the new phone when in the car takes longer to disconnect from bluetooth than the Galaxy s4, when hanging up from a call but I'm not worried about that. 1;	0.2	3.4
B01CJ3SCJ6	5	Great phone and sound First phone has issues with overheating and non-working speaker. Returned to seller with no issue and a new one was sent that works great. No overheating and the speaker has great sound. Shows very minor wear and tear on the sides which doesn't matter since I got a UAG case that covers it. Really happy with my phone as a replacement for my Galaxy Note 3. Still learning some of the features. 1;	0.5	4.6
B01CJ3SCJ6	5	Good phone This phone is great, arrived in great condition. The only problem was the phone was set to Korean? language. It was not easy to find the correct place to change it to English. However, that was just a minor inconvenience. We got it changed and it is great. Well worth the price. I hope it continues to function well for a long time. 1;	0.3	4.5

B01CR1FQMG	5	"All good so far. \TLDR: Great phone, looks new. Pay attention to who the seller is when you make your choice - the seller changes when you choose a different color. I bought from BuySPRY. All good so far. I was incredibly hesitant to buy a refurbished phone on Amazon after reading so many negative reviews on various products. I spent a lot of time researching my options and figured this one was probably my safest bet. Phone came in perfect condition (seriously, it looks brand new) and so far all the functions seem great. Set up was easy, unlocked, ready to set my fingerprint and everything. It's fast, sleek, and beautiful. Camera and audio are also great. What I learned: who the seller is is very important. Although all the phones on here are iPhone 6S 64GB, when you select a different color, the seller changes. When you scroll down and look at the section \""\""Compare to similar items\""\""  you will see who the phone is sold by. Looking at the reviews;"""	0.4	8.0
B01CR2IA6Y	5	I had purchased a space grey, 16gb iPhone 6s refurbished, from the seller Platinum Deals. Everything about this phone I was trying initially skeptical about, and after a select few reviews, I was definitely hesitant. But this experience, has been the best so far for any third party used or refurbished device. Everything, and I mean everything, was better or equal to expected. I fix phones for a living, so right away started a look over all the usual functions. All pass. In addition, the device was indeed in impeccable condition. Not a single scratch or even print for that matter packaged completely, precharged to about 30 percent, wiped everything of its past owner I would say one of the best parts, it came 3 days ahead of schedule! I paid in fact for free shipping( without prime) and still got it early. Very pleased with the service, product, and timely delivery, will definitely recommend in the future. 1;	0.3	5.9

B01CR2IA6Y	5	Overall a very good purchase... When the phone arrived you could hardly tell it was refurbished. It looked brand new. I had no problem switching my old phone over to this one on the At&T network. It works great. It is very fast and easy to navigate. Much better than my 4s that i was replacing. The only issue that I have and have had with every iPhone I have ever had, is the battery life. I used to use Blackberry's and I guess I got spoiled with their awesome battery life. I only had to charge my Blackberry every three days, and that was using it constantly. You would think Apple would work on that. You still need to charge them every day and usually twice a day. Overall though this was a very good purchase. 1;	0.3	6.7

B01DZJFWWS	5	Best (for a while) This is simply the best cell phone I have ever bought, and I have bought and tried out a lot of them. It's fast, charges in a couple of hours, the images are sharp and clear, the camera takes very nice pictures. In fact, I hardly ever use my tablet any more. I have not had any problems at all. It does not do weird, inexplicable things, like power off on its own, as my previous phone used to do. Update: Yes, this was the best, for 4 months. Then it went bonkers. First, it would no longer recognize the SIM card. No calls. After consulting both with carrier and with Motorola, both of whom recommended I do a factory reset (both sent how-to instructions)' I did the reset. I could no longer use the phone; it got stuck in one of the steps for restarting. Motorola then started talking about replacing. There was mention of fees, and of shipping cost, to be my responsibility. What!! I am sold a defective device and I have to pay for sending it back? I do not think so. I called Amazon. They are having UPS pick it up and are refunding around 75% of what I paid for it. I really liked this phone. Fast. Really fast. 1;	0.0	11.2

However, I did expect the fast charge to charge the phone a bit quicker (it takes around an hour and a half for an 85-90% charge).

B01F4889GE	5	"Don't Hesitate, try it ... Amazon gives 90 days to return without hassels. \I ordered Galaxy S7 refurbished and was little worried as to what quality i may get, but after i got this it looked like almost new. Battery was excellent. I have no regrets, but I had to return it because the signal was not good, it could be AT&T or may be just first few calls, I got one message from my wife twice and she said she sent it only once so I didn't want to take any chance and returned it. Experience of return to Amazon was the best you can get, since this item was \""\""fulfilled by Amazon\""\""  I always look for \""\""Fulfilled by Amazon\""\"" this way you don't interact with any third party. I was happy with the decision of Refurbished and have ordered another refurbished S7;"""	0.0	2.9
B01F4889GE	5	Works exactly as it should I have only purchased a cellphone directly from my carrier until now. I was skeptical but in the end it was exactly what I wanted. It was so easy to activate with my carrier and has great battery life. Condition was great but I always use a case anyway so I wasn't concerned with any blemishes anyway. All and all a good experience. 1;	0.7	4.3

B01FIW1B9S	5	After hours of updating the phone was a great buy. Was not a huge fan at 1st. Was happy with my S5 even added a larger battery in it that lasted for days. The S7 wouldn't even last a day at the start. The reason I upgraded was to receive the extended range T-Mobile band that the S5 wouldn't. Now that I have finally finished the literally 20 updates, the battery lasts longer and functions as it should. Be a little patient with updates and have a great phone. Phone was brand new in the box as well. No complaints there. 1;	0.2	4.1
B01FIW1B9S	5	Phonn was in basically perfect condition I couldnt beloeve how superb the device looked upon opening the package. i was expecting scratches styff, but there wasn't many AT ALL. Shipping was fast too. unfortunatley the only downside is that the charger that came with the device was only a 1.55A and the device requires at least a 2.5A charger. but the seller did mention that it was going to be aftermarket in the description so Im not too mad, ill just buy a seperate charger. but other than that the experience was great and would reccomend!! 1;	0.2	2.9

B01FJT7E0A	5	"Long Battery Life, No VoLTE \Owned this phone for about a year now. It received an update to Android 7. My main issue is lack of VoLTE and official band 12 support. The phone will drop to UMTS/HSPA+ in calls no matter what. There's an option to \""\""enable\""\"" VoLTE in the Android \""\""secret menu\""\""  but the carrier and Sony will not allow it. This phone has survived many 1 meter drops and indirect exposure to moisture in my pockets. I'm not sure if drop survival had to to do with the rubber case I have. I left the manufacturer's screen protector on for over a year;"""	-0.1	1.1

I've gotten the $90 phones and the $600 phones, and this is the closest to the $600 phone for the closest to the $90 price I've found. The screen is really nice and processor/memory is snappy enough to do about everything you could want to do. Then thanks to the price tag, you're not paranoid all the time that you might slip and drop it and be out a lot of money (or paying expensive insurance to avoid having that paranoia). 1;	0.4	2.1

B01FJT7E3M	5	Over all a pretty awesome phone This is an excellent phone for 250 bucks. If you like taking selfies especially. They didn't nick name this phone lord of the selfies for nothing. The frontal camera is fantastic. This is one of the few devices that offer a flash for the frontal cam furthermore apps run very smoothly and it's a pretty fast phone very little wait time for loading pages etc and easily handles running multiple applications. Is user friendly very easy to use the only real down side to this phone is that it has a small battery for the size of the phone and drains quickly when below 30% streaming video or playing games. It charges a bit slow but has over all decent battery life. With that being said I don't think you will find a better phone at the price. 1;	0.3	5.2
B01FJT7E3M	5	Highly Satisfied I've owned this phone for about 9 months now, and have been extremely satisfied. This was my first Sony phone, and it exceeded expectations. Nearly a year after constant use it still performs like day one. Great camera, good battery life, and a fast processor are my favorite features. The only real downside Ive experienced is that it's difficult to find good cases and screen protectors. Overall I highly recommend this phone, especially considering the lower price tag in comparison to its more expensive Apple and Samsung peers. 1;	0.6	4.7
B01FJT7E3M	5	Great mid range phone Bought this phone due to the looks and price so far in love with it the front facing camera is amazing has a great picture quality it has a pretty of features that make the phone easy to use especially being such a big phone the battery does deplete a little fast but nothing to worry about too extensively especially if you use the phones endurance certification mode which basically just limits certain apps from staying active when not in use so they don't drain the battery but overall for the price it is a great phone 1;	0.9	0.9

B01FJT7E3M	5	Satisfied customer Great looking phone, great performance and signal reception (I have metro with unlimited data), great cameras. Pros: Build quality, aesthetics, signal, cameras, screen quality and tactile responsiveness. The operating system doesn't have too much bloatware and is close to stock android. The phone is narrow so for a 6 inch device it feels very comfortable to handle. MicroSD slot supports high capacity storage. Cons: The rear camera is great but would have liked optical image stabilization on it instead of having it on the selfie camera. The phone is efficient with power consumption but the battery is too small so depending on usage it may not last all day. 1;	0.2	4.0

B01FJT7E3M	5	Sets up fast and simple (you don't need to be super hone savvy to set up) It's a large phone but deceptively light. Charges fast and the battery holds that charge for over a day (best I got thus far is 55 hours of charge). Sets up fast and simple (you don't need to be super hone savvy to set up). Camera is the best - both the main camera and the selfie camera. Pics are super clear and the options for your pics are pretty varied.

B01FJT7E3M	5	great camera. Beautiful phone in white I ordered this to get away from the phone contracts. Also tired of Samsung or Apple being the only majority choice on T- mobile. In my opinion Samsung's Galaxy phones are overrated . As for Apple tired of their DRM bullshit. I ordered this phone 1 and a half years ago. And I have not had a single problem with it. No slow downs. No freeze ups. No battery problems. I always had a feeling Apple was slowing down their phones and the truth just came to light recently. Don't get me wrong. I'm not a Apple or Samsung hater. In fact I was a big Apple fan back in 2007 when they released the Iphone. And I was a Samsung Galaxy fan also. I had the Galaxy 1 , Galaxy 2, and Galaxy 8 Edge. But after a while just got tired of their little upgrades here and there every year. And they both charge and arm and a leg for their flagship phones. So I went to Sony XA Ultra. This phone was fast on booth up, fast on apps , great camera. Beautiful phone in white. Sony had the AR effect on my phone already. And apple just came out with it on the Iphone 8 or is it the Iphone X recently . That is a joke . All in All great phone. Just to let you know this review is 1 and a half years later bought the phone in Sept of 2016 and it is already April 2018. I still have the phone and still runs great. I had just bought the unlocked Sony Xperia XA2 and upgraded. 1;	0.1	12.7

There is an independent camera button that enhances the camera. Phone just feels nice, it's made of nice materials. I could keep this phone for a while.

B01FJT7MZC	5	This ones a keeper. Loving this phone!!!! Only had it a week but so far this is super fast and the build quality is fantastic. Much heavier and I love that, today too many phones fell too lite and cheap. Runs 7.1.1 and shoud get Oreo from what I've read on it. Sound is great. Dual band WiFi and NFC which is a plus in my book. You can get cases for this phone easy and seems like these other phone if it's not Apple or Samsung you can't get a decent case. Call quality seems top notch and screen is excellent. If I had to see a weak spot on this phone would be the battery. Get around 4 1/2 Hrs. on this with moderate use.

B01FJT7MZC	5	Very good phone I like the size nicely fit in hand, and the water proof. My phone was accidentally left in swimsuit pocket and went under water about 15 min, the phone was fine. Unlike other reviews, finger print scanner worked nicely out of box. The phone has screen mirroring, media cast, DLNA, MirrorLink, NFC, 5G wifi, gyro sensor etc. lot of functionalities, which are usually missing in some budget phones. WiFi Miracast is convenient to mirror phone screen to TV, or cast movies to TV screen. MirrorLink can connect to car head unit although it is little tricky. I have both xperia x and x performance, x performance has faster snapdragon 820 CPU, but I don't see much difference in daily using. Xperia x has FM radio, X performance not. Xperia x doesn't have water proof. I have experienced few times the camera got over heat and shut down by itself. Battery life is not impressive. 1;	0.0	6.1
B01FJT7MZC	5	The phone is great I paid 300 bucks for this phone. It's pretty awesome it's perfect size waterproof takes amazing pics. I wish it had 4k video and 4gigs of ram. And wasn't lime gold but I'll live with it. The only negative for me is the battery sucks. I have a ps4 pro and I wanted to see remote play so I bought a Sony it works great I'll never use it probably but what the heck. It was a steal and I'm glad of it. 1;	0.3	3.4

Everything synced from my old phone within an hour, including apps, pictures, text messages, music, and contacts. The only annoying thing is that this phone isn't compatible with the majority of carriers out there. My old carrier, Virgin mobile, wasn't compatible so I went searching what carriers were and ended up with T-mobile. In the pictures I posted I have a pop socket on there (which didn't come with the phone) so it covers some of the back which has the \""\""Xperia\""\"" name on it  which I actually like a lot.

B01FJT7N4W	5	Best in the under $300 category Nice upgrade from a Moto X 2014 Pure. This phone is fast and fluid and takes very good pictures both in daylight and low light conditions. There is some bloatware, but that can be disabled no problem. The battery life isn't as bad as I thought according to other reviews, it's perfectly acceptable and has no trouble lasting an entire work day. LTE is plenty fast on the T-Mobile network. In the sub $300 category, it's very hard to beat because it includes features other phones in this category lack, namely NFC, amount of RAM, and a good camera. While it is a little over a year old at the time of purchase, I'd imagine the custom ROM community will keep it going once Sony declares it EOL. 1;	0.2	2.9

It is about as fast as an Iphone 7 (in my opinion). The main drawback to this phone is the ridiculous amount of updates you have to do before you can bring it up to current standards. So plan on spending about 4 hours doing this (no joke). The other drawback is that the phone overheats when you are out in the sun on a 90 degree day, so it might slow down when you are outside in the summer.

B01GQWT4SE	5	Cheaper phone that works! I purchased two of these recently, one for use here in the US and one for international use - particularly in Ecuador. So far both have lived up to my expectations. The US phone works great with the TracFone system (just make sure to buy their AT&T compatible nano sim card). In Ecuador I have to use a local provider, but that was simple enough to do in country. The interface is smooth and the sound quality is very good. 8GB is a bit small, but there is a spot for a micro SD card. All in all I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who wants a cheap phone that works well. 1;	0.3	3.6

B01GXAT0CE	5	iphone SE is a great little phone -- will use it as long as Apple provides O/S updates This is a phone for my husband. He needed a small phone to replace his iphone 5s (will not be supported when APPLE releases its Sept 2019 O/S IOS 13.) After watching YOUtube reviews, this seemed like the obvious replacement for him. The camera is on par with my own iphone 6sPLUS. The only thing is the O/S that came on the new/older iphone SE was way out of date. Itunes was not happy. It took me 4 hours to get it restored from his 5s. I had to re-install all the apps, passwords. The only thing that 'went over to the Apple SE from iTunes were the contacts and photos. It would be nice if Apple were to continue to support this iphone SE beyond 2019-20. Or put out an APPLE SE2. 1;	-0.1	3.6
B01GXAT0CE	5	Perfect condition The phone came on time, it was not in its original box but I really didn't expect that, the seller was buyspry. The phone was in a plastic case inside a generic phone box with a temporary screen cover on it and came with a cord and charger, it was perfect not a scratch or dent anywhere, and very clean! I plugged it in to my computer and it updated and charged, no problem at all with anything, I'm glad I bought this as a replacement phone for my sister. 1;	0.4	1.8
B01GXAT0CE	5	Call Me Surprised The phone is in like-new condition, which surprised me. I wasn't expecting the phone to be this nice, but glad it is since I just need it for one purpose. The battery condition is 90+% and lasts a couple hours using video chat. It came with an aftermarket charger that works just fine. I think buying refurbished will always be a gamble, since it is re-conditioned for a reason, usually. I would suggest making sure the return policy is generous. 1;	0.1	1.9
B01GXAT0CE	5	Works wonders. The phone came with a phone charging block, a lightning cable and the phone itself. The settings said that the battery life was around 90% and the overall everyday use of the phone is still pretty good even if the phone has aged over the years. The phone came really clean and the SIM worked like a charm the moment I popped it in the iPhone. Would really recommend using this phone if you're switching from a Android to the Apple environment. 1;	0.5	3.6

They were actually a Verizon produced charger box and cord. Popped my Verizon sim card in and it worked perfectly! I highly recommend this phone and would advise it to other phone buyers! 1;	0.3	5.0

B01GXAT0CE	5	Excellent value I won't leave comments on the specifications of an iPhone SE, but on the condition of this particular refurbished phone. Mine had a few barely-noticeable scratches on the body, but there was no damage to any buttons or the screen. Once the software updated, it worked exactly like it was supposed to. The headphone and charging ports are also in immaculate condition. Both cameras work the way they're supposed to and the phone is just as fast as any other iPhone SE I've used. It came with a generic Lightning/USB cable and wall adapter. It doesn't come with Earpods but Earpods aren't great anyway. I am really happy with this purchase. 1;	0.3	4.6
B01GXAT0CE	5	Like-new condition. Would buy again. The product is like new condition. It's been a few months and it's still working great. Unfortunately, the lightning cable sent with the phone is already not working sometimes, which is super frustrating. I honestly believe this is due to the poor design of the lightning cable rather than the manufacturer. I wish Apple would just go USB C all things, but that's a different story. Overall, great experience. 1;	0.1	4.3

B01GXAZFR8	5	Great backup iPhone Fans of iPhone SE's know what I mean when I say that it feels great in the hand. Charging speed is amazing. So I have a screen protector on it at times the touch is not as sensitive as I would like it to be. It would not respond to clicks readily. I am a die-hard Android user good quality build. My friends who use iPhones are happy that I have it but occasionally I will switch to my xiaomi mi mix 2 because of the large screen resolution along with very snappy fingerprint ID. IPhone SE fingerprint ID is a bit slow. Otherwise. 1;	0.1	4.0
B01GXAZFR8	5	"Just what I needed \I had got to the point where I decided I was going to stick with my iPhone 5 just because it was the perfect size and didn't need it for much else other than navigation, texting and a few other things. Then my son told me that this phone is the same size as my iPhone 5 and it has all the \""\""goodness\""\"" of an iPhone 6 including the better camera (which I will admit is the one thing I felt I wasn't perfectly happy with on my iPhone 5)! I liked the price and so I got one. It' perfect. Great condition and now has everything my 5 didn't have  plus now I'm taking great photos again!

B01GXAZFR8	5	Works like new So far so good. I’ve only had it for a week, but it’s looking promising. I loved my iPhone 5s but the newer iOS kills the battery, so I got this to replace it. I don’t want a screen any bigger than this and I still use the headphone jack, so hopefully this will hold up for a while. Other than a bit of easily cleaned out grime in the ear speaker and a nick on the corner, it could pass as new. 1;	0.2	2.8

I've been using it for almost 3 months and it works flawlessly. I got a sim card from Sprint and activated it with ease. I would say I am medium to minimal use in today's comparison of usage so the battery last the entire day. I almost went two days without charging it.

To do this, go to sprint.com/activate. Click on the \""\""Live Chat\""\"" button. The representative will attempt to add it for you (it won't work).

B01GXAZFR8	5	An Exceptional Deal on an Excellent Smart Phone! The iPhone SE I ordered arrived from 'DealFisher', the certified refurbisher, two days later in perfect condition. Except for not being packaged in an original Apple carton, I would swear the phone was brand new... not a single scratch or fingerprint anywhere. The phone arrived exactly as advertised, an unlocked, GSM, 64 GB iPhone SE. I simply plugged in a new Nano SIM Chip from TracFone (operating on T-Mobile 4G LTE service) and turned it on. The charger and lightning cord received with the phone work flawlessly. Nearly two months later, the SE phone is a true joy to use, extremely fast, and its small size is perfect to drop in a shirt or pants pocket. Being 'Unlocked' allows the freedom to utilize a number of different GSM service providers, and the 64GB storage capacity permits an almost unlimited use in the future. To prove how satisfied I am with this 'refurbished' (New) phone from DealFisher, two weeks ago I ordered an identical second iPhone SE for my wife! It also arrived two days later in perfect, and apparently brand new, condition. I figure the discounted 'refurbished' price and lack of sales tax, saved me about $150 on each phone, so I am an extremely 'Happy Camper'! 1;	0.6	7.2
B01H3V07EW	5	Great Phone! Why waste your time and buy phones that are locked through US Carriers. Why waste money and buy phone just for the brand name when there is another that can deliver the same performance, reliability and at times even better. Why waste time and money buying a phone full of bloatware from the carriers. I bought this one and later upgraded to the older brother OnePlus 6. The OnePlus line is solid, great performance, that Dual sim is great for international travelers and even if you refuse to be tied to one provider.

B01HFD0XJM	5	Just don't forget the case!!!!! Breaks so easy! Serious flaw in this phone. It is slick as snot. It has fallen out of my pocket while I was sitting 3 different times and each time has added another new crack in the glass. 2 on the front and 1 on the back. Probably my bad for not getting a case for it but come on. I am NOT a gorilla and expect a little more durability when it falls 2 feet. If I didn't get this for half the original price I would be really upset. As for the phone itself I love it and can't wait until the S8 comes down in price. Yeah I will buy a case for that one.

It was really difficult to find it because it's not available for the US but it totally worth the trouble. I got the italian edition of it and it works nice and smooth with my Mexican SIM card, it doesn't has any preloaded content which is great and the preinstalled apps are the same as the US version. The only \""\""issue\""\"" might be that the power connector of the charger is European  but the seller solved it in a great way by including an American adapter.

B01L1BOQT2	5	Excellent deal- exactly as advertised. I am very pleased. I am very happy with the iPhone SE that I purchased from this vendor. It came in perfect condition, not a single blemish of any sort. Even the packaging was good. I bought it to replace a 16Gb iPhone SE. Apple has dragged its feet forever on issuing and new iPhone SE 2 and I was running out of space so I bought this one. Now that I have the space I will most likely stay with this mobile handset for a long time. 1;	0.3	4.4
B01L1BOQT2	5	Scratched on the back but works perfectly So far so good. My old SE was vibrating nonstop and I didn’t want to get the new phone since they’re so big.

B01L1BOQT2	5	Battery life only 81% - otherwise, great phone! Everything works as it should, popped in my SIM card and immediately got a text from my carrier.

Mine had 100% of original battery. I also have the X (provided by work) and I honestly prefer the SE. It has the head phone jack, the finger print sensor, and fits in my hand.

B01LACBLEK	5	"The most comprehensive review on here. With occasional particularly dry humor best suited for intellectuals and the British \Want to make a long story short here. I can't... Here we go then. I bought an older xperia a little while back, also of the compact line. I really enjoy the small size and other things myself nostalgic for how the first couple generations of smartphones were. If fact I'm also nostalgic for when phones didn't run or live but... Hey... I may not fall into the social media trap like most millennial but the online banking and instant account access is just so darn convenient... But I digress. The first xperia I bought was a 2014 model on a certain site that shan't be named but you all know which one. You know... The auctions and such. I can't say for sure but I think the international location that sold it to me for so cheap cannibalized the better parts because for some reason the serial registered as a Nokia lumina. Go figure. Won't buy a phone on that site again. However, cannibalized or not I was impressed by Sony's phone. I disregarded the pitfalls of it being an older model, and it was great for a year until I dropped it, but that was the glass panel model without the re-enforced gorilla like this model has. We'll get to that in a moment. The phone is fantastic, actually the favorite of any phone I've ever used but a long shot. I've had models from about every brand mind you; iPhone, Samsung, Motorola, LG, Nokia, and blackberry are just a few that come to mind. I get bored easily and like to switch things up, until of course I met the Sony Xperia line. I never buy another phone brand now. For this generation, love the compact size, think I covered that. Body of the phone is plastic. I hear from a lot of people \""\""doesn't that make it look and feel cheap?\""\"". No not really  what a silly analysis.

And unlike those devices, this phone has a really classy and unique look. It has a slightly beveled glass screen which I initially overlooked, but adds to the phone's class. The specs were right for me on this phone - not quite as powerful as the current top of the line phones at purchase, but also half the price. And it has a better camera to boot.

Screen is sharp, not 4k but Im not sure why you would need a 4k resolution on a phone screen. The battery life is amazing as was my other Sony; I can have everything on, bluetooth (which is communicating with my fitbit all day), GPS and wifi and Ill get down to maybe 50% at the end of the day.

B01LEL8ABY	5	Better than an iphone. Why this is not spanking the snot out of iphone is beyond me. Apparently, moto z does not advertise much, this is the best phone I have ever had. It is durable, sound is great. The snap on batteries and accessories make it killer. The battery is ok (like an iphone when new) but when you slap that battery pack on the back - holy moly. I only charge this phone once to twice a week and I am seriously heavy user. I cannot tell you how many times I have dropped this phone and it is like a timex watch - takes a lickin' but keeps on ticking. If you are looking to go to the dark side (android) this should be your go to device. Once you have it you will wonder why you ever had an iphone in the first place. 1;	0.0	4.8
B01LEL8ABY	5	Great phone for processing. Not so much for pictures. Total step up from the Honor 5X. I love that phone, but it was getting to be really sluggish I've I decided to Uber and Lyft. The Moto Z blows it out of the water in terms of performance. 4GB RAM, 64 GB internal memory, SD 820 processor, Adreno 530... All good upgrades, except the battery capacity is lower. 5X has 3000 mAh battery, this is at 2600. I'm sure with the SD 820 there's better energy management, but still, a higher capacity would be nice; however, due to this aspect this phone is super thin and light in comparison. The camera isn't something worth oogling about. It's not bad, just not as good as some of the others in it's price range. I actually got this for $185 on Prime Day (super awesome deal on something that never came out of the box since it was manufactured). When using the camera, I can't tell if I've been drinking or if the phone is drinking because it'll follow in whatever direction you move and sway. Lag or adaptive tech, hard to say. Bottom line, this phone is a really good upgrade if you're into speed and simplicity, not so much if you're one of those selfie posers. 1;	0.0	7.0

Both were a big upgrade from my 2014 Moto X, and both were reasonably priced. I also spent hours and days comparing phones from Huawei/Honor, LG, Nokia, sketchy no-name Chinese brands etc. I initially bought a used example for $260ish, which didn't recognize my SIM card, but got to know it for most of a month while I waited for a new SIM card to come in. It was my phone for at home when there's no signal anyway. The new SIM didn't work so I returned. By that point, the \""\""new in box\""\"" price of the Moto Z had dropped to $299.

B01LZ2SO4L	5	"I LOVE THIS PHONE \I used to have a Samsung Galaxy Core Prime, so I'll be honest in saying that really anything was probably going to be a step up. When I was looking for a new phone, I really wanted something with a nice camera. The Google Pixel XL certainly delivers. The camera is great for snapping selfies, or, if you're me, taking tons of photos of your dog. They look good in most lighting situations, but obviously will turn out way better in brighter light (such as natural light from the sun) rather than low light / dim lighting. Either way, I'm impressed with the crisp, detailed photos I can get and with this phone my dog just might become an Instagram celebrity. The only thing I don't necessarily like about the phone is that there is no SD card slot. I purchased the 35gb version just after Christmas (so late December/early January) and so far after nearly 7 months have not maxed out the memory. I imagine when I do it will be because of the thousands of high quality dog photos I've been taking (plus a handful of short videos), which I'll just move to a flashdrive or something. Photos are automatically backed up to a cloud if you so choose (which i believe is connected to your google drive??) but i honestly have no idea how to access that, so I'd rather save them externally myself. Overall the phone is responsive and easy to use, I love the camera and the fingerprint scanner is a nice touch that I never knew I needed. The battery usually lasts me about 2 - 2.5 days, but I tend to use my computer a whole lot more than I use my phone. How long it will last depends on how much you're using it, of course. I bought this product used from the seller \""\""TheGizmoTrader\""\"" who I would recommend because their listings all have photos of the phone so you can see the amount of wear. The phone I picked was listed as \""\""very good\""\"" quality and looks almost new  aside from a very thin hairline scratch on the screen which is almost unnoticeable. I also received the phone within a week of purchasing it;"""	0.3	7.1

When I first purchased this phone, the battery life was atrocious. But then they had a system update and just holy cow, they made it perfect. The battery life is long, the phone works excellent, I've had it over a year now and it still works fine. I bought a google Daydream VR to use with the phone and its so much fun! I just honestly don't know what to say negatively about this phone. I love it and I'm probably going to get this phone again when I finally break this one. 1;	0.5	6.6
B01M01YX15	5	Great phone The price of this phone was a good value. Initially the battery life wasn't the greatest, but if you go into settings and shut off a lot of background stuff that is running, my phone can last almost 2 days. It was dying by the afternoon otherwise. So if you are having battery life issues, try playing around with some of the settings. Even though this is an older generation model, it still works perfect with the Marshmallow platform. No complaints, other than the case selection is a little slim due to the fact that it's an older model. 1;	0.3	4.1
B01M01YX15	5	Pics are beautiful! Great phone so far. Battery lasts for a long time. There is 128 mb memory so the response time is great! Perfect size and takes amazing pictures! Google format and Google Assistant is great! 1;	0.6	4.5
B01M01YX15	5	Best phone of 2016 This phone is amazing, it was a gift for my wife to replace her old Galaxy 3 ( yes, she had a Samsung Galaxy 3), we received a brand new sealed factory phone, and so far she is happy. 1;	0.5	1.0

B01M1CTCO0	5	Great phone . I have only had this phone for a few days, but I love it so far. I will update my review at a later time if anything changes. I realize that the Google Pixel XL is not the newest version of the phone, but I bought it new and unlocked 128 GB for $200. Much more reasonable then purchasing the Google Pixel 3a for over $600. It's a solid phone and has the newest OS. There is plenty of room for all the apps I need/ want. I am able to use it on the page plus cellular network (Verizon 3rd party), and it makes cellphone ownership much more affordable. Having an unlocked phone is great because now I don't have to pay extra fees and I am not stuck in a lengthy contract. Through page plus cellular, it cost $30 flat a month for unlimited calls and text and 3GB of data. I've used a Samsung Galaxy for several years, which I loved, but the Google Pixel is just as good, if not better! 1;	0.3	6.1

B01M1CTCO0	5	Pixel XL worth the money! Phone came very fast and safely via UPS. It's packaged with a charging cord (USB type C), charging block, and a micro to USB C adapter. It is the Pixel XL first gen as described and completely unlocked. All I had to do was get a new sim card and transfer my service. Transferring my data from old to new phone was easy with the adapter. Phone is in brand new condition. My only complaint is that it came with a serial/IMEI identification sticker directly on the back and i had to use baby oil to remove it. Amazing vivid camera and high quality video. Sound is good for me I just find the speaker is easy to accidentally cover up. By far the best phone I have ever had! 1;	0.4	5.2

B01M1HY1E3	5	Sony midrange phone! Upgraded from Xperia Z3 to XZ and was worth it. The phone's hardware and software are fantastic. Love the design and features of the phone. The performance runs smooth without any lag. Latest software updates from previous ones (6.0-8.0). Being a gsm phone it works great with T-Mobile, AT&T, etc. The only thing I didn't like is that the fingerprint scanner is disabled. The seller send the product with all accessories package in original box. I received it quickly with my choice of shipment. 1;	0.4	5.4
B01M1HY1E3	5	Xperia is still the best Loving the phone so far. Xperia is my new go-to phone after switching from an LG G4 which was horrible and bootlooped on me twice forcing me to replace my G4 twice, and the third phone (which is my phone before this one) now has a non-functioning back camera. Sorry excuse for a phone compared to this one. 1;	-0.2	2.8
B01M1HY1E3	5	Pretty well known electronics company; compatible with other Android devices, and connects flawlessly with a ps4 controller. Fits my needs quite well, and without network bloatware. The design is an attractive conservative look, to me, and sticks out from the crowd of over saturation that is the u.s. phone market. Thank god it isn't a carrier specific phone 1;	0.3	1.5
B01M1HY1E3	5	Great phone, great price The speakers are really good quality and the screen resolution and camera are top notch. Only thing on my wish list it didn't have is a fingerprint scanner, but that is definitely something I can live without. 1;	0.6	1.8

Don't know if in the details it wins or looses to iphones or Samsung but the overall exterior and performance combo wins the total battle for me. Its different and out of the everyday cell phone you see in every other hand. Got it in an awesome deal on Cyber Monday for 499$, that makes the value very good. 1;	0.5	4.2

B01M4HGVJ7	5	Like New Phone The phone was flawless with no scratches anywhere on the body. The screen was in perfect shape, no burn-in, no dead pixels. I went over this phone with a 10x hand lens and could find no imperfections anywhere on the exterior. Every feature/function of the phone was exemplary. The only negative with the phone that I found was the aging battery which is to be expected for a 2 year old phone's original battery. 1;	0.5	3.5
B01M4HGVJ7	5	Good deal! For $212 I got virtually a brand new phone. Started right up with no problems. Swapped my simcard out and activated the phone.

B01M4HGVJ7	5	This is a trusted company in the USA quality assured The battery life is not the best but it is a product offered by a third party that handles a good portion of most USA based mobile carrier refurbishing, replacement and insurance stuff so you can rest assured the products are exactly as advertised with quality inspection and all the fixes of a primary company based refurbishment.

B01M4HGVJ7	5	Great Phone Bought this for my wife for mother's day and was very nervous about it being refurbished but, phone is awesome! Had it for only a week but I'm thoroughly impressed. It is locked into t mobiles network and we are obviously t mobile users and had no problems connecting. Immaculate condition and great packaging. Upgraded from an s4 so was expecting a noticeable difference and it definitely is. We buy our phones outright to avoid being locked into contracts so we were looking for a good deal on a fairly new generation, mission accomplished. If you are the same and cant stand to part with 800 bucks for a new phone this is definitely the way to go. 1;	0.3	4.4
B01M4HGVJ7	5	Great phone for the money - good camera I bought this S7 phone for my wife because her old S2 was going downhill fast. Because of the price I didn't mind buying a preowned phone. It came on time and is perfect. The phone does everything she needs it to do. She's into a lot of social media with the kids and grandkids that live in another state. We like the gold color, and the camera is better than any phone camera we've owned. I think the battery has aged a little bit, but she says the battery life is great. 1;	0.4	4.0
B01M4HGVJ7	5	Love this phone! Perfect condition, like new. Took almost a week to ship. It is locked but I simply called TMobile and they unlocked it for free in 24 hours.

B01M7O431L	5	Refurbished doesn't mean problems, it means any problems have been corrected and phone is 100%! Great phone, and I live the fact that this refurbished phone was 1/3 the cost as its brand new counterparts in cost. I highly recommend getting a refurbished cell phone based on the fact that if there were any issues with the device, they have typically already been corrected for so you get the technology at a fraction of the cost. I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend others consider this much more affordable option for calm phone replacement when the time comes to get yourself a new device! 1;	0.7	3.5

B01M7O431L	5	Great phone, like new and only two minor issues. The phone arrived in almost new condition and appears to work just fine. I have had it for about two weeks. There were two minor issues that aren't a huge deal in my opinion. The first is the charger, I don't believe I was supposed to get a Samsung charger but the one that shipped with the phone is an off brand that did not charge very fast, like 10% in one hour. I switched the charger to one of my older Samsung chargers and it charged much faster and completed the charge in a couple of hours. The second issue is that the SIM card for the S7 Edge is smaller than the one for my S5. If you go to a Verizon store (not an independent store) they will change it out for free which is what I did. Again not a huge deal, I may not have noticed if they mentioned it so it is fine. All in all it sure beats paying the price for a new phone. 1;	0.1	3.2

B01M7O431L	5	The first one I got seemed fine.. Last time I bought a refurbished phone (not from this company) it was an s5. The first one I got seemed fine...except it wouldn't accept my SIM card. So it was completely useless as, you know, a phone. I returned it for a new one, and this time I got one with a broken headphone jack (which I didn't care too much about) and the phone was unable to tell when i tried to put it into landscape mode. I decided just to not bother anymore, and keep it. With this phone, I checked over everything. Orientation, camera, SIM and sd card, apps, mic, speaker, jack, usb, battery life--everything I thought could go wrong. Everything seemed perfectly in order. Works absolutely lovely. As for the phone itself, I highly recommend. Great battery life, smooth performance and feel, and I like that it can accept both a SIM and sd card at the same time, as I've seen many newer phones that can't. 1;	0.0	7.3
B01M7O431L	5	Best Bang for your Buck!! Best money ever spent!! Phone is breathtaking right from the start. Had NO issue at ALL getting it set up with Verizon (did try a Metro PCS sim, it didn't work---but that's ok because Verizon has wider service). Phone is fast and works fantastic. So happy I took a leap of faith and purchased this product (it wasn't listed as being UNLOCKED---that scared me some). Works like a charm!! 1;	0.7	5.6

B01MDMJGYT	5	"Excellent phone! DOES work with Republic Wireless! \We've had a Moto Z Play since it came out about 2.5 years ago and love it. Recently the charging port became damaged and then the repair place removed the battery (after which it expands and can't be reinstalled). Anyway repairs were going to be $200 so it made more sense to just get a new one. We use Republic Wireless and they require the \""\""North American Unlocked\""\"" version 1635-02 which was difficult to find. I read the reviews and saw that some people had luck with this \""\""International\""\"" version with Republic Wireless so we gave it a shot. Phone arrived today (Love Prime One Day!) so we charged it up and then put the SIM card in. We began doing the Android updates (which were in Spanish so I was a little nervous) but kept going. After about the 6th update Republic Wireless activated! SO happy! This phone is awesome  battery is amazing;"""	0.3	5.6

B01MDMJGYT	5	Love this particular version of Moto Z Play phone I like this version better from experience than what I've read about the Z2 and Z3. I don't like the fact that the newer versions lowered the camera quality and battery life. That's why when my prior Z Play decided to go downhill after a few yrs of use I read up on the newer ones and decided that at this time I'll stick with a new one of my same z play. However, I did not like the whole international cord/plug that came with it. That's just personal preference I suppose and it did come with a US adapter to put on there.. but now my darn plug sticks up like 2in above the outlet. 1;	-0.1	2.5

B01MSEPCPU	5	Great Renewed iPhone 7 Great Seller My wife and I have iPods and iPads but have been using android cell phones for years. I wanted to switch to apple phone but with the high entry cost have waited. I decided that I wanted an iPhone 7 renewed so I check the feedback on various sellers. I chose to buy from BuySPRY and could not be more pleased. I could not find any scratches or marks anywhere on the phone. It appears to be new. The phone was unlocked so I had no trouble moving it to my old carrier. I actually use Tracfone and moving was an easy process. I highly recommend BuySPRY and will use them again when I purchase a replacement for my wife's android and she moves to iPhone. 1;	0.2	3.2

It came in a plain white box, it did come with brand new apple charger. The phone looks brand new. No scratches, the screen and back have a protective film on it which I appreciate.

I've had it for going on two months now, and have had ample time to use it and work with it daily. I'm completely satisfied with this phone: it was as good as new and nothing I saw would have indicated otherwise. It was delivered on time, it performs as I hoped it would, with overall great battery life (for what I do with streaming and downloads) AND functionality.

Great phone, and I live the fact that this refurbished phone was 1/3 the cost as its brand new counterparts in cost. I highly recommend getting a refurbished cell phone based on the fact that if there were any issues with the device, they have typically already been corrected for so you get the technology at a fraction of the cost. I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend others consider this much more affordable option for calm phone replacement when the time comes to get yourself a new device! 1;	0.7	3.5

B01N9XOXCK	5	Great phone, like new and only two minor issues. The phone arrived in almost new condition and appears to work just fine. I have had it for about two weeks. There were two minor issues that aren't a huge deal in my opinion. The first is the charger, I don't believe I was supposed to get a Samsung charger but the one that shipped with the phone is an off brand that did not charge very fast, like 10% in one hour. I switched the charger to one of my older Samsung chargers and it charged much faster and completed the charge in a couple of hours. The second issue is that the SIM card for the S7 Edge is smaller than the one for my S5. If you go to a Verizon store (not an independent store) they will change it out for free which is what I did. Again not a huge deal, I may not have noticed if they mentioned it so it is fine. All in all it sure beats paying the price for a new phone. 1;	0.1	3.2

B01N9XOXCK	5	The first one I got seemed fine.. Last time I bought a refurbished phone (not from this company) it was an s5. The first one I got seemed fine...except it wouldn't accept my SIM card. So it was completely useless as, you know, a phone. I returned it for a new one, and this time I got one with a broken headphone jack (which I didn't care too much about) and the phone was unable to tell when i tried to put it into landscape mode. I decided just to not bother anymore, and keep it. With this phone, I checked over everything. Orientation, camera, SIM and sd card, apps, mic, speaker, jack, usb, battery life--everything I thought could go wrong. Everything seemed perfectly in order. Works absolutely lovely. As for the phone itself, I highly recommend. Great battery life, smooth performance and feel, and I like that it can accept both a SIM and sd card at the same time, as I've seen many newer phones that can't. 1;	0.0	7.3
B01N9XOXCK	5	Best Bang for your Buck!! Best money ever spent!! Phone is breathtaking right from the start. Had NO issue at ALL getting it set up with Verizon (did try a Metro PCS sim, it didn't work---but that's ok because Verizon has wider service). Phone is fast and works fantastic.

Everything works: touch ID, front and read cameras, facetime, WiFi, Bluetooth, and 4G on T-Mobile (GSM). The only thing I did not like was that I got the phone with a battery health around 82%. It can still hold a whole day of usage without problem, but I think the page description should state that the battery might not be a new one. 1;	0.0	2.0

B06W2M6RT2	5	Couldn't be happier Tried a different company on Prime. Had to send the phone back to them, as it was possibly stolen and useless. Ended up spending a little more money here, but I'm SO much happier. I went from an S3 to this, and granted my phone was ancient in phone standards these days, I really do love this phone. The camera is superb, the speed is light years faster. I'm happy. Also, there were no delays in getting me the phone, I almost wonder if it was new instead of refurbished based on the quality and box (bonus!), and it came with a charger, a new sim card, a sim card holder release thingy, that plug where you can transfer all of your data from your old phone to your new phone (I know, I'm super techy with my lingo...sorry for any confusion), and headphones to boot. It's like I got it from the store, only at a fraction of the cost. I'm a happy girl. 1;	0.4	6.4

B06X9FL2PW	5	Works with Verizon and Looks New Ordered this to replace my mother's SE which broke after years of use. This arrived in a timely manner - within a day of ordering. Setup had to be done by my mother since she was across the country when she received the phone. SD card swapping was easy enough considering her lack of tech skills. The phone is certainly unlocked for Verizon users. This was one of the only SE phones I could find which was unlocked for Verizon. Based off the price and the condition the phone was in, I would order again from this company if needed. If something goes horribly wrong with the phone for some reason in the next few weeks (that isn't due to my mother dropping it or something), I'll update this review. 1;	0.0	2.0

Also sometimes just unlocking the phone takes multiple tries. Sony told me to take it to a third party repair shop, as the warranty expired three weeks before I called about it.

B06X9HVVC5	5	Samsung/LG eat your hearts out; SONY takes the cake. PRO TIP: Buy a Love Mei tough case and a tempered glass screen protector for this phone!!! It will turn the Xperia XA1 into a tank of a phone! Make sure to use Locktite on the Love Mei's screws too. And put the tempered glass on before you put it in the case; the phone still works perfectly with TWO layers of tempered glass over the screen. I included a pic of the Love Mei case so you can see the size of it. Great phone with perfect touch response and color. Not true 1080p but you'd have to get a magnifying glass to see the pixels. The processor is fast. I have not suffered ANY issues of lag or freezing unlike other smartphones (looking at you Samsung and LG). The 23mp camera is fantastic! It takes truly great quality photos outdoors and indoors as well as handling itself well in low-light. The 8mp second camera is more than enough for selfies too. This is the perfect phone for hiking and phone photographers. 1;	0.4	8.3

B06XD2NLFS	5	Fantastic Battery life and screen. The Mods Rock! My wife needed a phone that will last all day for her job since she travels. And can add more memory. This fulfilled the need and even more. She switched from an iPhone (6yrs iPhone user) and was pleasantly surprised how much customization she can do to the Android Moto Z play V.S the iPhone. Add the battery Mod and it will last 2 full days of use without the need to charge. I also fixed her issue of forgetting login and password by using Chrome Browser. Now it all syncs with her laptop to her Moto Z play. When she uses her Cell Chrome browsers it automatically remembers her logins for her. The screen is very bright and vibrant. The phone feels high end with the metal build. Comes with Android 7.0 We inserted a 64gb sd card over the already good size 32gb. I think it can take a lot more memory. The projector Mod is a must have also. It really projects like a big screen TV. Pretty amazing. My daughter also has the same phone. They love it. 1;	0.4	10.0

B06XR2D5S1	5	Definitely a good buy and I love it. Preface; I upgraded from a Galaxy S4. I had been having troubles with my phone for some time before I got this one(literally using it as I write this!). I wasn’t ever into Apple, but I needed a new phone and 300$ wasn’t bad for a 7. So why not. I’m probably never going back to a Galaxy. Phone was in perfect condition when I got it for being refurbished. No scratches, no hardware issues, no dents/chips. The only real issue with it was that the battery was at 90% health whenever I got it. That’s still pretty solid since Apple recommends replacing the battery at 80% health. On a 100% charge I can get a full 12 hour shift without it dying on me with reasonably heavy use(no games, just like DMs, Social Media, browsing, Discord, and general day to day stuff.) If you’re looking into getting an iPhone 7 this is probably the best way to do so if you can’t find a straight talk one on sale or something. Everywhere around where I live had them for like 400+ refurbished. 1;	0.3	5.0
B06XR2D5S1	5	Excellent purchase❗️❗️ I got iPhone 7 (256 gb) from verizon pre owned and works flawlessly without any issues except battery life cycle (86%). This isn't a problem for me because i can easily get a new battery and boost my battery life and with the efficiency of A10 fusion chip this phone amazes me. Before you buy something from amazon make sure you do a research from who you are buying due to scammers trying to sell electronics using amazon. Also, not everything in here is 100% certified from major carriers or company. So make sure you pay attention to this detail, and don't let your eyes fool you if you see a company logo because scammers can easily use company logos to advertise their products. Make you sure you talk to them before buying. Well, too much writing, my product was almost brand new with no scratches at all❗️ 1;	0.0	3.5

We live 1000 miles apart and she was able to go right in to her service provider and switch everything over no problem at all. Her previous phone was a flip phone with a slide out QWERTY keyboard, so upgrading to the iPhone 6 was a big jump. But, thanks to the ease of use that comes with an iPhone, it’s been a smooth transition. I cannot attest to the battery life, but being able to share pictures, videos, and the occasional emoji with my mom are well worth 5 stars. 1;	0.4	3.4

The Amazon renewed guarantee is confusing because if the third-party only has a 30 day return policy. That’s all you get not 90 days. I got mine at Blutek Intl and we are thrilled. Cosmetically like new with 100% battery. I also received an email from Amazon saying it was an Amazon refreshed phone and I had a full 90 warranty. Also, I did not buy the cheapest phone at $167, I went down the list and found it a seller with very high ratings and $185 price tag; well worth the extra $18. If you are not sure if the seller gives the full 90 days, I would recommend calling Amazon; they call you back in 30 seconds! Make sure you understand what you are buying BEFORE you buy it. I also wish people would mention what Seller they bought from, good or bad. Rants with no Seller names are not very helpful. 1;	-0.1	4.5
B06XRJQX91	5	Great phone, would and have recommended to friends! Phone came in great condition! Screen has plastic peely and package includes iPhone box and a charger that is not OEM but is compatible! The phone's battery life is pretty bad but I believe that is inherent to the model, not because it is refurbished. I had a lot of trouble setting this up with my carrier (T-Mobile) but after chatting with them then finally getting on a phone call with a technical specialist we were able to troubleshoot and modify some settings and it works fully now! If you do contact your carrier, let them know that it is an unlocked phone not designated to the specific carrier, so they can address your issues quicker! Would and have recommended this product to friends! 1;	0.2	3.8
B06XRJQX91	5	Just as described Bought this phone as a replacement when my iPhone 8 Plus got stolen. The phone was delivered within 2 days. Looks brand new- no scratches, dents, etc. I was able to easily activate the phone with my existing Verizon phone number. Only downside, as other comments have said, is that the Snapchat camera does make the shutter sound and I can't find a way to turn it off. Other than that, I'm very pleased with my purchase and got exactly what I was expecting. 1;	0.2	2.3

B06XRJQX91	5	Excellent condition and fully unlocked as described. Would buy again... Review for the 6S 64Gb, refurbished, rose gold. Excellent condition with no signs of wear or use! Phone received in a box similar to the original with a simple screen protector (for shipping), replacement charger and cable (non OEM). Everything looks new and works properly-phone was fully unlocked. Only negative, but which is totally acceptable is that the battery is slightly weak (83%) as per the new (beta) Battery status in IOS 11.3. Performance of the phone is not impacted much however. The phone had the previous version so this information was probably not available to the seller. Plan to visit the Genius Bar to have that replaced soon. Overall, all my expectations were met! 1;	0.4	5.9
B06XRJQX91	5	Iphone for life At first, I was reluctant to purchase an Apple IPhone, I thought it cost too much. however, after I purchased this IPhone, I do not think I could ever see myself with any phone other than an IPhone. This phone rocks. 1;	-0.2	1.6

B06XS2GWFC	5	Advanced Quality By far the best phone purchase I've ever made! I own this as well as a far more expensive Galaxy S7 Edge and this phone is just as advanced in my opinion. System updates are incredibly advanced for such an inexpensive phone. Quality screen, battery life, great storage, and very durable. If you are looking for a great phone on a budget it doesn't get better than this. Absolutely recommend and would purchase again (but so far mine has lasted so I haven't had to.) 1;	0.5	4.4
B06XS2GWFC	5	Great value for the money Upgraded after having the J3 Emerge for over a year. Wanted a better camera. The Perx is a little bigger than the J3 Emerge, I actually like the smaller J3 but the J7 is worth the better camera and the small upgrades. The Galaxy J series phones have been fantastic. I've had a dozen smart phones with Virgin Mobile over the last few years and the Samsung phones are among the best. Really great phone for the money. 1;	0.5	4.4

B06Y16521Q	5	Phone is good I like the phone very much. The battery life is just OK. It came with one charger that doesn't fit into USB ports.

B06Y16521Q	5	Great Buy. Perfect Cell Phone. Was expecting a nick or scratch here or there for the cost, but the the two phones they sent me were perfect. No complaints or anything.

B06Y16RL4W	5	Exceptional, Peerless Phone For its price, this phone is a steal. I originally purchased a Xiaomi Pocophone F1 and was disappointed, and decided to replace it with the S8+. Its incredible how the S8+ outperforms. I'll list a few things worth considering if you're thinking about getting an S8+. The display's color and contrast are top of the line. I've been using an s9+ for awhile now as my personal phone and had gotten use to its vibrancy and depth, after giving the Pocophone F1 a shot I realize Samsung's AMOLEDs are just out of this world amazing. Granted the F1 is an IPS display, but from a user experience perspective alone the S8+ really delivers if visuals are a priority to you. The S8+'s speed and performance are fantastic. The hardware you get for this price point is amazing, where my S8+ performs about 95% as fast as my S9+ when using demanding software. The phone's glass and metal exterior is very durable, handling drops well and not scratching with common items. I do have one complaint, however: the fingerprint scanner's location is pretty terrible. If you have smaller hands, I imagine it will be difficult to reach. I would have preferred it to be centered below the camera instead of beside it. All in all, for a little under $400 you won't find a phone remotely as exceptional as the S8/S8+. Samsung has always been the go-to name for flagship android devices, and this phone is an example of why that is. 1;	0.3	8.9
B06Y16RL4W	5	I give this phone five stars. Great screen, great processor, great software This camera has been reviewed about 18,000,000 times. If you're looking for some incredible insight or new understanding of how the Samsung SA plus works, there are lots of phone reviews that will give you the incredibly detailed evaluation I got this as a replacement phone for a significant other. That person has one basic need. To send messages, to make calls, and to get a camera that can take good pictures. I have the exact same phone but I have the note 8. I think the note 8 is the absolute best phone I've ever had. I use the pen for taking notes and making quick reminders. I also use the pen to edit the pictures and I have multiple photo editing programs. They require a fine touch and my fat fingers don't work. If you don't need the pen, this is the same phone and does everything but does not have this slightly added size and slightly diminished battery that the note 8 has. Apparently when they add the stylus they take a little bit away from the battery and add a little bit to the size and weight of the phone. Android on this phone works great. Yes it comes with tons of bloatware but it can be left alone or removed. Bixby is a absolute pain and the Bixby button is nothing but an annoyance. I downloaded an app that allowed it to be reprogrammed. Unfortunately, Samsung keeps updating the phone and seems to have an ulterior motive to remove the option of reprogramming the Bixby button. Fortunately, app developers are only one step behind and update the app the minute that Samsung seems to interfere with the app function. In the last year I've used this type of phone it has a great screen, great processor, incredible touch, and the O LED screen is awesome. I read a lot of reviews of people who broke their phone or commented that the touchscreen was diminished after they put a screen protector on. I've use this phone for a year without a screen protector. I understand the anger and hostility of people who broken their screen on a very expensive phone shortly after purchase. Unfortunately, accidents happen and any phone can have a screen that breaks due to either clumsiness or inadvertent shock. And, putting a glass screen protector on the phone will diminish the touchscreen capability. I have not used a screen protector any year, carry it in my pocket and have zero scratches. Take off your protector and enjoy the beauty of the phone In my experience, this phone is five stars. Great GPS, great Google voice recognition, great screen, processor works and seems to be able to handle everything you throw at it. 1;	0.1	14.9
B06Y16RL4W	5	Looks Good! I got tired of being forcibly throttled by iOS. I had an iPhone 7 and like my iPad Air 2 both seem to be running slower and slower regardless of actions taken to remedy. I decided to go back to Android. This S8+ COULD redeem Android for me as prior Android phones were slow, laggy, and poor performers that proved unreliable. This phone is fast, works smooth with minimal issue and most importantly, is reliable. Unfortunately some of the little, insignificant things have not been resolved but functionality is much higher than with my iPhone 7. Of course, it is still early on, if I have any issues, I will update my review as usual. 1;	0.0	5.5
B06Y16RL4W	5	Battery Life at least two days I was getting sick and tired of my one day battery life on my old phone. The Samsung S8+ is rated higher than the S9+ for battery life so I went for it. It was several hundred dollars less than what Verizon wanted. I charge it every other day now. The bad: Well, not that bad. My Verizon caller ID no longer worked because this is an unlocked version (kind of generic so to speak) Also my Verizon voicemail (visual voicemail) was not available. Big deal,I found another. No issues. I am using the free app Hiya for caller ID and block. Awesome. 1;	0.0	3.7
B06Y16RL4W	5	Perfect Condition!!! So, like many of yall I was a little skeptical about buying a phone online. I've never done it before, however.. I have had it since Monday and it came in perfect condition, there was no scratches, no dings and the software runs perfectly. I just slipped my AT&T sim card into it and here we are. Lol, honestly, everything about this phone is so good, the camera quality is great, the battery lasts me ALL day and I constantly scroll through apps. The screen is big and bright so you can see everything you are reading and I love how thin and easy to hold the phone is. I 100% recommend this phone to anyone!! 1;	0.5	5.3
B06Y16RL4W	5	I am very satisfied with the phone Overall, I am very satisfied with the phone. The camera is quite good but it doesn't handle low-light as well as I had hoped. The screen is definitely scratch resistant (you can scratch at the screen with your keys and it won't leave a mark). The glass (front and back) are NOT impact resistant and you can expect them to crack the first time the phone falls from your hands and hits a hard floor (I was aware of this issue beforehand, so no complaints here). 1;	0.1	1.9
B06Y16RL4W	5	You get what you pay for.. Paid 489.99, knowing it had cosmetic damage and used. Came with clear case and charger. Had phone for 2 days. Technology speaking: so far so good. Only two minor obvious scratches and 1 barely noticable (mind you it was to be expected) but both were on the back screen which appears to be easily replaced and I'm the type of person to take the time out to do that.the other is easily covered with a case...no front screen damage, came two days early; seems like a steal for an avg $800/unlocked phone. 1;	0.0	2.6
B06Y16RL4W	5	Great phone! I am extremely satisfied with this phone. Had no issues activating it with my current Verizon account. Just went to the retailer for a free SIM card and they set everything up. One thing that I wished I had known prior to purchasing this was that with an unlocked phone you will not have voicemail notifications. This is software that is installed by carriers onto the carrier specific phones. The only way you will know if you have voicemail is to call your mailbox. There are some apps available to download so this really isn't an issue. I just wish I had known about this so I wouldnt have missed some messages. 1;	0.3	4.1
B06Y16RL4W	5	No problem with this Samsung S8+ Of course since my old Samsung was an S5, it took a bit of learning. The phone it's self works great.

I don't agree with reviewers on the bezels or on the corners. I think they make for an easier grip and less false touching on the phone. The chrome finish turns a lot of heads too which can be kinda fun. The xperia fork of android is minimalistic without being bare so the device is very clean cut and smooth running.

B06ZZVZKTR	5	Moto's E is for Excellent - - Budget Phone. Reality is, this is a great budget phone. Android is stable, charges a a decent speed. Best part? User replaceable and Swappable Battery. I get at least 1 day of moderate usage on a full charge - but not a power user or game player. Screen is bright for regular use, and sound is fairly decent. Bluetooth works awesome, and headphone port provides enough juice to listen to tunes or videos online, or my favorite items off my plex.tv server. Wireless is more than suitable for 99.9% of users. Only missing item I can tell is NFC support. But let's not expect miracles for the price. 1;	0.4	6.7

B06ZZVZKTR	5	King of Most Budget Friendly Phones When it comes to the most budget friendly devices that are worth using Motorola is pretty much king. The Moto E4 is an improvement although shares many features that the Moto G Play had. It runs Android Nougat (unlike the G Play which has Marshmallow) and although it won't be seeing Oreo it does receive security updates (about every two to three months I think). It has has a fingerprint reader which is impressive for a phone in this price range (about $129.99). Motorola also managed to make a durable smartphone. (For a truly rugged smartphone pair with the Poetic Revolution case). This phone is unlocked and will work on every major carrier's network, including Verizon and Sprint's. This is also a feather in Motorola's hat, as many budget unlocked phones are still AT&T and T-Mobile's networks (GSM) only. 1;	0.4	4.8
B06ZZVZKTR	5	Great Value If you are like me, a cell phone is a tool for communication. It is not an entertainment device. As such, I want excellent reliability and good performance. I am not gaming or watching movies. I am make phone calls or sending text messages when necessary. Why spend a grand on a phone when spending $129 dollars will do. The fourth generation Moto E4 is the perfect solution for me. Here is an example. I have been awake since midnight. I turned on the phone at that time. It is now 4:48 PM and the phone is at 77 percent charge. Estimated battery charge remaining is three days according to the battery metering system on the phone. My old iPhone 5s would redline if I tried to make a call after a few short hours. If you want low cost and great performance, this is it. 1;	0.1	5.6
B06ZZVZKTR	5	Another great phone from Motorola! I have had a cellular phone for over 16 years, and they have all been Motorola's! I have never had a single problem with any of them, and the same goes for this one! Now you have seen the reviews about problems with it stop reading the sim cards, but they have fixed the problem, and anyone that still has this problem, can fix it very easily - by downloading the sim card update, that is if the phone did not download it automatically already. The quad core processor is very fast, and the phone does a great job of picking up towers that are out of reach of most other cell phones! So after having this phone for over 7 months, I can say in confidence, that it is another great phone from Motorola! 1;	0.3	3.6
B06ZZVZKTR	5	"this is the ABSOLUTE BEST phone you're gonna be able to get at the ... \I've been using this phone for a couple of weeks now, and I figured I'd share my thoughts on it real quick. One thing I wanna say before anything else though, is that if you have $230 to spend AND care at all about having a 13MP camera and/or a 1080p display, definitely look into a Moto G5 Plus. If you are missing either of those things, this is the ABSOLUTE BEST phone you're gonna be able to get at the given price point. In fact, my personal advice is that even if you do have an extra $100 to burn, just buy this phone and save yourself some money. Take that statement with a MASSIVE grain of salt of course, as this is only a review, but I think you'd appreciate the savings... Build Quality - This phone has (as far as I can tell) an all-plastic body. The back it textured and feels nice to hold, and the body itself is surprisingly slim. Despite being all-plastic, it doesn't feel cheap, and with the battery inserted, it has a decent amount of heft to it that makes it feel like a more substantial piece of tech. Also, I just wanted to note that Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is a marvel of modern technology. Combined with an oleophobic coating AND a splash resistant coating, the screen on the Moto E4 cleans up incredibly nicely, and is nearly impossible to scratch with simple day-to-day use. Hell, even trying to scratch it PURPOSEFULLY proves to be a difficult task. Although it won't hold up very well to long drops onto hard surfaces (plastic backing isn't that durable, and Glass 3 can be VERY brittle on impact), the Moto E4 should have no problem being stuffed into rough pockets or handled with greasy hands. The OS - Android 7.1 Nougat, pure and simple. It rocks, and it's the most recent OS you can get right now. (What? What's this OREO you speak of? Pshhhh...) The Processor - Certainly, there are faster processors out there if you're willing to spend more cash. DO NOT, however, discount the MediaTek CPU in this phone as incapable. Android Nougat 7.1 runs incredibly well on this device, and the processor, no matter how much crap reviewers will give it, can stand up to pretty much anything you throw at it (that is, if you're not playing demanding 3D games on your phone... like... I can't even think of any). Really, you have nothing to worry about with this processor. It does its job very well, and it shouldn't put you off from buying the phone. The Display - Vibrant and very sharp, and it seems that 720p resolution is perfectly adequate for a device of this size. Frankly, for $130, this phone's display is very good. The Camera - If anything, I'd say that the camera is the weakest part of the phone. It has LED flash for both the front and rear cameras, which is handy in certain situations. That said, the HDR function is a little on the slow side of things, and the image quality could be sharper. Still, it's not bad for a phone this inexpensive. It works pretty well, but it's definitely no reason to buy this phone on its own. The Speakers - They're alright. Probably the same idea as the camera for most. They're alright, and that's pretty much it. Hey, the cuts in cost have to come from SOMEWHERE, right? Anyway, if you're looking for a good phone that's still \""\""relevant\""\"" in 2017 and won't make you sad for lack of performance (or of funding)  buy this one. You'll like it;"""	0.2	17.6
B06ZZVZKTR	5	Really an amazing phone and incredible deal for the price Really an amazing phone and incredible deal for the price. If you owned a Moto X or any other Motorola phone over the last few years you'll appreciate the build quality and stripped-down Android interface. Sprint customers have to keep in mind that they have to get a SIM card either mail door from a store, however the stores don't always carry them and you may have to wait a few days like I did. I think this phone can go head-to-head with any Samsung Galaxy phone that is literally three times more expensive or dare I say and overpriced iPhone. 1;	0.0	2.0
B06ZZVZKTR	5	Incredible Value - Great Phone Very surprised by high quality and speed of this phone for an incredibly reasonable price. Snappy performance and is well built. Screen is very sharp. Can't do better in this price range. Motorola makes solid phones with no bloatware. Cell coverage is fine and wifi works great. Just be prepared to run several automatic android updates out of the box (took maybe an hour to run all the updates). 1;	0.3	3.6
B06ZZVZKTR	5	Great phone, good value, replacable battery. I've had this phone about two weeks now. Battery life with heavy use means I charge it every other day.

The camera is not as good on paper as my last phone but I have zero complaints. A very serviceable phone that is priced excellent. 1;	0.2	3.0

I gave this phone a try to test out a large phone for the first time. I was amazed by the features of the phone. No preloaded apps that I had to uninstall, only the basic apps. I can use up my internal memory for other apps that are more important. The front camera was awesome, looked very similar to the camera of my Samsung S7. The amazing part was it was the FRONT camera. The back camera was even more amazing. Any vaction landscaping pictures will look absolutely amazing. The speaker was louder than any sony phone I've owned. I usally use the bluetooth for headphones or the car stereo. However, anyone looking to listen to jams this is great. The 4GB RAM was good enough for me. I ran multiple applications at once without a problem. The battery ran good throughout the day without dying. The last thing that to mention that other find important is the fingerprint sensor. The fingerprint sensor was disable on my phone. I personally don't mind it but to others its the end of the world. This phone feels, looks, and runs great. 1;	0.4	11.3

B071ZDQ6MV	5	High end phone at a budget price. Great phone! Great phone. This phone is on par with phones 3 and 4 times as expensive. Great performance, good signal strength, great camera. Exceptional build quality and feel. This is my second Nokia 6. The first worked flawlessly. I dropped the phone 30ft to concrete (phone not in case). It shattered the screen in the top left corner (how it landed) but phone and screen still worked. Bought a case and screen protector for this one. Not sure if that would've helped in a 30ft fall to concrete but it's a little added protection. Also dropped my old Nokia 6 from about 4ft to blactop pavement, landed flat on the screen, figured it had to have cracked the screen but I picked it up and it didn't have a scratch on it so the phone should survive most drops without a case. If you're looking for a high end phone but don't want to pay $800 - $1000 bucks for one I would highly recommend this phone. 1;	0.2	6.7

Screen is nice, a bit large if you operate the phone with a single hand/thumb but a large screen has its obvious advantages. Interface is snappy for everyday tasks (I'm not gaming with the phone). Camera seems average to good but not incredible. FM Radio is an added bonus (when you attach the supplied ear plugs as an antenna). Sound quality of the supplied ear plugs is not good but I have my own. Fingerprint scanner works very well. Battery lasts sufficiently long. Capable and usable phone with a nice build quality and Finnish. 1;	0.2	5.9
B071ZDQ6MV	5	High Quality Smartphone Really difficult to find fault with this phone, especially for the price. I like the audio quality (I stream a lot of music) and the clean up-to-date Android OS. No bloatware, just Google apps which is fine. Sure, you can get faster chipsets for this price range, but this phone seems plenty speedy to me. I opted for build quality. This phone is really solidly built, and really nice looking. Some critics kind of bashed the camera but I think that's nit-picking. I have no complaints with image quality or camera function. Also, the display is beautiful... love this phone. 1;	0.5	5.7
B071ZDQ6MV	5	Good performance for the money If you want to pick the phone which gives you the best bang for the buck then in my opinion this is a very good contender. I do like the screen and the fact that performance wise is doing everything I need it to do. As an example, the Sygic application is running smoothly and the phone doesn't heat up and the battery consumption is pretty good. 1;	0.5	2.1

B071ZDQ6MV	5	One of those phones where you feel like you get more than you paid. AT&T user. I'm extremely happy with this phone. I don't think there's a more solidly built phone out there. Nokia built a brick with a LCD screen. The phone is snappy and responsive. The fingerprint reader is quick. Stock Android is always a plus. You don't have to worry about bloatware. If you're hoping for a flagship like an S10 or iPhone X, then you're in the wrong market. But for less than $150 this phone over delivers. For a budget smartphone, it does exactly what you need it to do, and does it well. It doesn't lag, battery life is good, and the camera is decent. I'm on AT&T and the Volte and Wifi calling looks like it works for me. Reception is very strong. Did I mention the thing is built like a tank? I've never had a phone that felt so solid in my hand. Seriously, when the zombies show up, this phone is the perfect handheld weapon to crush some skulls. Accessories are a little thin for this version of the Nokia but you can find a good case and screen protector if you need it. Overall, to me this phone is worth every cent. 1;	0.3	10.2
B071ZDQ6MV	5	Good phone so far! Great screen, plenty fast and lots of storage. I had the same wifi issue at home that others have where it wouldn't connect. I had to go in and change the channel on the router to a lower number and then no issues. I bought this prior to a trip to the UK, so I will reserve full judgement until I take it out and about a bit and see how the signal is and how it connects to public wifi here and there. Will update after a couple of weeks. 1;	0.2	3.3

B071ZN4K8V	5	Great budget performance, my second one of these Yes, it's 2019 and this is a three year old phone, BUT, if you don't mind a few trade-offs these original Pixels are tough to beat from a value to performance standpoint. The trade-offs are mainly outdated big bezels and less battery life over the new Pixel 3A. The Pixel 3A has a fractionally larger screen than the OG XL, but the OG XL still has better screen resolution and can be had with 128gb of memory whereas the 3A is maxed at 64gb. Performance-wise not too much of an edge for the 3A. We have a few of these OG Pixel XL phones in the household, all refreshed/refurbished models and no problems with any of them. This last one purchased here could pass for brand new, battery, screen, and all. The OG Pixels are good for one more Android OS update from Google and in my opinion still represent a lot of Android phone for the money. Maybe we have been lucky but our refreshed Pixel XL's have worked and continue to work great- no issues at all. I would not rule out purchasing a Pixel 3A for myself but not at over twice the cost of what I paid for one of these OG XL's. 1;	0.2	4.4
B071ZN4K8V	5	Definitely worth it. I was very skeptical about refurbed products because of my past experiences. Certainly other reviews are important to consider and one should sift through and decide if the negative reviews are justified or people whining about silly things like battery life. Android pie is. Battery hog. Most phones are. Anyways this device is a great value. I got the device a day early and it came in great condition. It's a refurbed device so my expectations were a little lower. It performs great. No issues so far. But I'll be sure to update should this thing fail. That's life right? Sometimes things happen. But I am enjoying this device and that's all that matters. 1;	0.4	8.2
B071ZN4K8V	5	Google pixel is for GODS! I seen a lot of scetchy reviews and I was concerned. I really liked the price so I took a shot anyway. This phone is incredible! I love this phone so much! It arrived an hour before expected and I signed for it, which made me feel a whole lot better. No problem with the phone what so ever! Has really awesome features like a finger print scan on the back. Google Assistant allows you to communicate with your device without having to touch it. And you could ask follow up questions as if you were having a conversation. I haven't a clue why other customers had bad luck with ordering this product but I say it's worth the try. Besides, it's not like you can't get a refund if something happens to it. Also comes with a 90 day warranty. Good luck! 😁 1;	0.3	7.4
B071ZN4K8V	5	It's worth taking a chance, don't believe all bad reviews There are so many reviews only saying bad things about this phone, realize that it is a used phone so yes you are taking a chance but what I got out of it was amazing! I looked all over this phone and don't see a mark on it. The phone itself works perfectly with absolutely nothing wrong with it, almost like they sent me a brand new phone instead of a used one. The Google Pixel itself is a phone worth taking a chance on. I love this phone!! 1;	0.3	3.2
B071ZN4K8V	5	They were good about cancelling my first order when I decided to ... Had mine for about a week no problems, other then I had to take it to the Sprint store to have them active it. They did say you could do it over the phone too. I bought my phone from BuySPRY. They were good about cancelling my first order when I decided to get the 128 gig instead of the 32 gig. So far this phone is worth it, no problems found or anything. If the phone craps out on me I'll up date the review. But so far I love this phone. Hopefully it'll last. These refurbished items are sometimes hit or miss. 1;	0.2	3.7
B071ZN4K8V	5	Cannot receive incoming calls** fixed with unlocking carrier per one person instructions This phone would be so amazing if I could receive incoming calls and communicate with iPhones. Tried support from Amazon but that would require the ability to receive incoming calls. Still trying to fix before returning. Will update if it can be fixed.*** Fixed! Used the developer admin and got it to unlock. So very exciting. My phone is now perfect. 1;	0.2	3.3
B071ZN4K8V	5	Just as described - Love it I never leave feedback and wanted to with this purchase because i was apprehensive due to the ratings being all over on this item. A phone is a pretty big deal to me, I had my old one for almost 4 years. I needed an upgrade and didn't want to spend too much money. This phone came on time and just as described, no scratches, box was a pixel xl. I took it to a Verizon store and they inserted a new sims card (old phone was not compatible and I don't have the tool to insert/ remove it) and I was off, maybe there 5 minutes. Easy to set up. If things take a turn for the worse I'll update, but as of day 2 I love it! 1;	0.1	3.7
B071ZN4K8V	5	It seems to be fine. It's a shame I had to buy white to get this pricing. I killed my Nexus 6p and needed a new phone. I'm on Google FI, and was waiting for the new pixel 3 but had to take a shortcut when I killed my phone. It seems to be fine. 1;	0.0	2.2
B071ZN4K8V	5	Never going back to Android or iOs This phone is amazing. I'm in love with it for real. The camera is amazing, the interface is so user friendly and it has all of these little things I wish other phones had. I will be a google phone customer for life, or until they mess up REAL bad. Battery dies pretty quick, but I think that's because mine was refurbished. 1;	0.4	3.5
B071ZN4K8V	5	Solid Phone With Everything You Need What a great phone this is. Although I bought this phone a year and a half after it came out (due to my Nexus 6p breaking) I am extremely pleased with it. Yes, the bezels are big and the speakers aren't front facing, but those two are my only complaints. I can last 2 days on one charge. The screen is nice and vibrant, easy to see in sunlight, and color accurate. The cameras are excellent with the back camera taking amazing photos even in a casual setting and the front camera taking clear and crisp photos. 1;	0.6	4.7

Since my own verizon iphone can not be used in China, this Pixel XL is really useful when I am traveling. 1;	0.2	2.9
B071ZN4K8V	5	Good Value if Refurbished Properly I bought a certified refurbished Google Pixel from a seller called Edge Cellular. The phone looked new and there were no scratches or dents. It was packaged securely and came with a charger and USB to USB-C adapter. I've been using this phone for two weeks and haven't run across any problems with calls, data, messaging, or using my phone as a wifi hotspot. 1;	0.4	1.9
B071ZN4K8V	5	Good Phone I bought my Pixel from Cell Surfers. It works great. It was in very good condition. There were maybe a couple very tiny scratches but I really had to look for them.

B071ZN4K8V	5	Other than small cosmetic flaws the phone seems brand new. Bought through Amazon Services, not another retailer. Had some very mild scratching around the usb-c port and a few flecks on the back that honestly just look like dust. I don't even notice them with my case on. Screen was in perfect condition. Battery life has been as advertised for a heavy user. Other than small cosmetic flaws the phone seems brand new. 1;	0.2	2.7

B071ZN4K8V	5	Check out my review! I received my pixel XL yesterday which would have been 8/29/19. The owner was good enough to provide a case and a screen protector as well something that I wasn't expecting. I did purchase an additional case which is completely fine I rather have two then none at all so thank you very much. The device has minimal scratches around the bezel and that is, because it is metal you have to keep that in mind if you decide to buy this device it is the first generation pixel and unfortunately Google thought it would be cool to make it metal. Battery life for me is good because I'm an avid Android user and I understand how the battery drains, brief explanation Google does the battery on a 1% increment that is still present with the pixel one devices, I don't know how it is on the 2 or the 3. I was able to bump the device up to Android Q beta no issues at all. It is unlocked and working with my T-Mobile SIM card no problem. Speaker quality on my device or tho on the bottom works good, when and if you get the device it may need to be bumped up with system updates which should bring some new tweaks to the camera there's no portrait mode so if you want to device that has that sorry. overall I'm happy with my purchase and how quick I was able to receive the product thank you guys very much and I hope my review helps as well. 1;	0.2	4.0
B071ZN4K8V	5	Best Phone I've Had To Date. Pixel XL, 32GB, is a quality phone and I haven't discovered any cons yet. The camera is the best I've ever had to date, the color appears life like on screen. Finger print scanner is fast! Start up and shut down is fast, is going to get Android Q, in fact I have Q-Beta on mine currently. Now, my seller advertised the phone like new, but it has a bit of metal missing from top right corner of metal trim like it was dropped, and on opposite side the metal trim has flashing not trimmed off. The phone is unlocked and I'm running mine on, Mint Mobile sim card, who wholesales T-Mobile sim cards. The phone should last an eight hour day, and quick charge is fastest I've seen. 1;	0.4	5.2
B071ZN4K8V	5	Like Apple, Google Pitches Nothing But the Best The phone does everything you could want. One-third the original offering price. Unlocked (I use Consumer Cellular). 128 GB gives space for everything you need or want to add (you get greedy). Beautiful photos! Finger-print security. Complaints? Google tries to turn all your defaults into Google apps and services without permission, so you have to stay alert if you want to use any others. Also, does not supply a wide enough range of ringtones to satisfy me, but I got them free from the app store. 1;	0.1	4.1

B0728HMXFD	5	Most pleased. Received quickly in pristine condition. Model engraving as well as software confirmed tablet was a mini 4 with 128 gigs, both wifi and cellular. System had been reset and software, including ios had been almost completely updated. Only one update remained to load. While I didn't go over the tablet with a magnifying glass, there were no noticeable scratches, dents, dings, or smudges. Not even a fingerprint.

B0728HMXFD	5	Super deal! I was very pleased with the iPad mini 4. I had one and shattered the glass. It was going to be expensive to repair. So I thought I’d look for a replacement one because I have no issues with the other one I broke. I was excited they had it in more memory. It ended up being about the same as if I’d replaced mine except I have more memory! I got it the next day after ordering it. It is in great physical condition. I haven’t seen any defects. The battery appears to charge all the way up so no problems there either! I am very pleased! 1;	0.2	5.4

B072KNNF33	5	good as new I was a little hesitant to make a big purchase like this online especially when I saw a fair amount of negative reviews but Amazon had earned my trust so I went for it. I have only had it for a few days thus far so maybe I am jumping the gun but so far I am very impressed. The phone is in perfect condition and the battery life (which I was nervous about) is also like-new. If they had marketed it as a brand new phone and put it in original packaging then I would have been completely duped. The only weird thing is that it is a T-Mobile phone even though it is marketed as ATT but it has been completely compatible so I'm not complaining. If I have any problems then I will come back and change my rating but for now, I could not be happier with my purchase. I feel like I got a great deal 1;	0.5	5.8
B072KNNF33	5	Works as expected Only sign that this phone was refurbished is a very light scratch on the back that's covered by my phone case anyways.

B072ZWCKP5	5	Great First Smartphone This is our first smart phone and we are impressed. We paid for the version without the Amazon ads. We like being able to use them with any carrier and the bare version of Android 7 without all the extra software you get with locked phones is great. It is nice to be able to pick and choose our preferred software rather than what a carrier thinks we need. If you don't mind Amazon's software choices and ads these phones are available at a considerable discount. The batteries last several days without needing to be charged and the screen size is great for everything I have tried to do with it. I don't notice much difference between this phone and a mini iPad when streaming video. 1;	0.3	4.0
B072ZWCKP5	5	Amazon Music Works on Sprint Got this phone for my daughter for Christmas and couldn't be happier... both of us. For just over $115 this phone is a steal. All previous reviews rave about battery life and this is true. Screen is large and clear. Compared to my $500 Nexus 6P this phone is great and I won't freak out if it is lost or accidently broken because of it's low cost. I'm not a tech person but wanted to comment about concerns about this phone and problems on the Sprint network. Earlier reviews mentioned problems streaming music from Spotify and Pandora with this phone on the Sprint network. I was concerned that this would also be a problem with Amazon Music streaming. It is not. When we activated our phone we went to a non-corporate Sprint store and they did not have the right SIM card so we drove over to a Sprint Corporate store and 20 minutes later we were all hooked-up and are able to stream music on Amazon Prime with no problems. Same with Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube etc. So if you use these products and are on the Sprint network, and were concerned about streaming, you should be good with this phone. Totally happy! 1;	0.1	5.2
B072ZWCKP5	5	Completely Compatible with Sprint I bought this phone and it is much better than I expected. The camera works well and all of the apps run smoothly contrary to other reports of apps such as pandora not functioning with sprint. I purchased the wrong byod chip from sprint at first and the online tech (incorrectly) told me the device was not unlocked and that I should reach out to the vendor. I had my suspicions that this tech just didn't know what they were doing so both wrote to the vendor of this phone and went into the sprint store to seek advice from another tech. As soon as the other tech told me I had been using the wrong type of chip and installed it in my phone, the phone worked like a dream. In addition the vendor of the phone immediately reached out to me. My conclusion from this experience from this is that the phone works great (my previous phone was an iphone SE, so my standards are high) and the customer service is also good. 1;	0.0	3.9
B072ZWCKP5	5	Good value, great battery. If you want an unlocked phone that performs well, but don't have to have the latest-and-greatest, this phone is a great value. I use it with republic wireless and it works well as a phone as well as runs apps well. I am particularly impressed with how long the battery lasts. It will easily keep charged all day with moderate use (depends on how much you use the screen, and how bright, of course). I've forgotten to put it on the charger and ended up going a couple days and still had plenty of power. 1;	0.5	3.8
B072ZWCKP5	5	I love the phone and I loved its price and I ... I love the phone and I loved its price and I have absolutely no complains about it. What I want to convey here is that a buyer needs to be aware that Verizon Wireless has issues with phones not purchased from them, whether real or artificial. In my case, everything worked except the phone could not receive TXT messages. Oddly, the phone could send TXT messages but not receive them. I spent a lot of time with the store folks - a bad experience - and the customer support folks who were really courteous and trying to help, but the bottom line is that the phone did not work. Further, they use it as a mantra: if not purchase from them, it is a know problem. Just beware. I ended up switching to AT&T where there was no problem. 1;	0.0	4.1

B072ZWCKP5	5	Great phone! I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of this phone. I have had no issues or complaints in the month I have had it.

B072ZWCKP5	5	Great value for the price I love the battery life on this. It's not jam packed with features but works well if that's what you're ok with. I like the blue light feature that comes on at night to minimize eye strain. The one thing I was missing on this phone that was available on my old phone was the ability to keep the phone unlocked at home. For some reason this isn't an option with this phone. But I am very much a fan of this purpose. 1;	0.4	3.8
B072ZWCKP5	5	Good price, good phone So far so good! Replaced my Moto G2 with this and so far I'm pleased. Seems to take decent photos. It's a lot bigger than my G2 but I kinda like that. The storage (32 GB) is really nice, I have lots of apps, books and music and haven't even used half! I love the fingerprint scanner, too! I keep phones until they die so hopefully this one will work for as long as my G2 did (over 3 years!). 1;	0.4	4.0
B072ZWCKP5	5	Quick and Easy, better then last Model My Moto G was Dying. At the Time I thought it was completely dead. So i wanted a replacement fast. I was happy with my Moto G so i went for the Moto E. It arrived quickly, i got it running and activated easily, and because i got the old one to accept a charge, i transferred everything. So it is like my old phone which i was happy with, but larger, faster, more streamlined, and has new features i didn't know i would want but am glad i have them now. 1;	0.3	3.3
B072ZWCKP5	5	Great Phone! Amazing Battery! I just bought this phone for my mom. The battery life is insane. She's a light user and gets on average 3 days of battery life on the phone. Her previous LG phone lasted maybe a day with light usage. I have a Moto Z2 Play so I knew the Moto E4 Plus was going to be a perfect fit for her. She was surprised at how quickly she learned the stock Android OS. Now she brags about that and how long the battery lasts. I will continue to recommend Motorola phones to my family and friends. 1;	0.4	4.9
B072ZWCKP5	5	Great for those who are fed up with $900+ phones Great for those who are fed up with $900+ phones. If you don't need tap-n-pay or wireless charging, save yourself a lot of $$$. Also, not only is the battery replaceable (don't remove it unless it fails though), I've hit the 4-day mark without a recharge and it said it was good for another day -- I play sleep sounds all night until I wake up, but I'm not on it much during the day. 1;	0.0	1.4
B072ZWCKP5	5	Worth the extra money over e4 Love the price point and features available on this at that point. I think it's working great for my mom. Large battery and screen is clear and great.

B072ZWCKP5	5	Good battery, solid phone Good battery, solid phone. Went from an s6 edge to this, didn't notice much of a difference. Good screen, not too hard of an adjustment. For a new budget phone probably the best you can't get compatible with Verizon. 1;	0.2	2.6
B072ZWCKP5	5	Greatest battery life I've ever seen in a phone Greatest battery life I've ever seen in a phone.

For the money though, it is spectacular. 1;	0.2	2.7
B072ZWCKP5	5	Solid phone for the price I bought this phone for my mother for Christmas. I was looking for a phone with a large screen, on the android system, decent camera, unlocked, easy to use, and under $200. She has used it for a week now and is very pleased with the purchase. Even my 20 year old brother was happy with the operating system and specs. For the price, I would recommend to this phone to others. 1;	0.5	3.5
B072ZWCKP5	5	Works fine with Red Pocket which is what I bought it for. I like that it works well and has a very long lasting battery. I read some review that said the screen resolution is low for a 5.5-inch screen but it is fine and I really don't watch video on small screens. I think the plastic is cheap but just as cheap as my last phone so I expect it will last as long as I treat it well. 1;	0.2	2.0

B072ZWCKP5	5	Great Phone~ Definitely worth the money, and no bloatware! I have been a dedicated Samsung user for years. However, the last 2 phones I had, we huge let downs. My best friend had an older Motorola, and was upgrading to this E plus. She got her's and let me look at it, and mess around for a few days, until her Sim card arrived. Anyway, I started researching new phones, and was not impressed with what really was offered, as far as what I needed it for. I use prepaid Verizon, and went to their store to see what kind of deal I could get with new service & a phone instead of the prepaid. They had nothing I remotely would lock into a 2 year service plan for. I went to AT& T because they were offering the new Samsung 8 buy one get one free, what a joke that was. Anyway, after eyeballing this EPlus, and researching reviews that were legitimate. I decided to take a chance. Since getting the phone, and trying and figuring it out I absolutely love this phone. Basically if you are used to Samsungs or Android platforms, this phone is just a stripped down Android, meaning it doesn't come with all the bloatware that Samsungs and others do with preinstalled apps that cannot be removed. I opted for the model with no ads I bought my daughter the HD8 and upgraded because the ads were so annoying. This phone is perfect for me,. The battery life nothing short of amazing. The screen nice, sharp and clean. The only thing I didn't like at first was everything is devoted to Google~ no phone gallery to store pics, and no option to view pics in the camera mode that is my only complaintl Other than that, its a great phone and 32g with expandable memory awesome.Most phone are not offering expanded memory anymore. So yes I would reccommend this phone to anyone, after getting used to it ! 1;	0.1	11.6

B072ZWCKP5	5	Great phone. I might buy 3 more for the other users. great phone. Got the moto e plus 4th gen 16 gb and put a 128 gig memory card in it. No advertisements on it as well. I just had a Samsung s4, then a note 5. I loved the s4 and this phone is closer to that. I hate the note 5 because it costs like $700 and honestly isn't any better than this. Maybe worse because I can't expand the memory in the note 5. Id much rather have this phone. Pros: battery access micro sd card cheap cons: none so far FYI: I didn't think it had a memory card expansion slot in it at first. Its not clear in the instructions. It actually sits on top of the SIM card. 1;	0.0	5.5

B072ZWCKP5	5	This phone is very sturdy and worth your money. This is the sturdiest phone I have owned in my entire life. Today it was dropped in the mud as I was getting into my car. It sat there in the mud, getting rained on for 5 hours, and then was run over by our full size truck. The screen LCD is broken on all but the top quarter, meaning that the top quarter is the only part where you can see what is happening on the phone. However, the touch screen is completely functional after a reboot. This phone is well worth your money in my opinion. When the phone was functioning correctly, I occasionally would have troubles with the fingerprint reader, but that was usually because the sensor needed wiped off. The screen resolution was wonderful as well. 1;	0.1	4.3
B072ZWCKP5	5	"Best deal in smartphones, bar none! \Although nearly too large for my favourite belt bag, this has proven to be a very capable CDMA smartphone running on Verizon Wireless towers via the Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) reseller PagePlus brand of America Movil. Since bringing it online at the beginning of Nov. 2017, it has performed close to flawlessly. Best features: sometimes sold unlocked so that it can be used on either GSM or CDMA networks; simply enormous run-time due to it being the largest lithium polymer battery (5000 mAh) currently available in mobile phones; fingerprint security access; windowed screen (2 apps running simultaneously) under Android Nougat; 32GB internal storage with sdcard port for up to 256GB additional storage for personal files. The large battery makes the phone a bit bottom-heavy and slightly difficult to handle one-handed, especially if your hand is small like mine! That makes a protective case and screen cover just about mandatory. These accessories will set you back another USD $30-$40, but they more than make up for the cost by protecting your investment in the phone. While this phone is a real bargain -- currently ranging from USD $160-$250 new; some carriers like Boost offering it locked to their system for as low as USD $80) -- particularly when compared to the Samsung and Google brand phones costing hundreds more, it still isn't exactly cheap. Protection plans may make sense, but they come close to costing as much as the hardware in this instance. I prefer protecting myself in other ways. One great option is to round up an older Sprint or ATT phone and set it up on FreedomPop.com. For $8 a month, I get 200 minutes talk, 500 texts, and 500MB of mobile data -- unused data even rolls over up to a total of 4GB. With my old LG G3 CDMA on FreedomPop, any issues with my Moto (mechanical or service related) can be dealt with or endured with some creative forwarding of voice and text while I keep going with my backup phone. So I'm clearly a big fan of this phone. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles (no NFC if you're into swiping your phone like a credit card to pay for things; no 3D rendering for fancy virtual reality apps), but if you want a rock solid device that does the basics and quite a bit more, and want it to run literally for DAYS with a bit of frugal power management, then look no farther! EDIT 2018-03-01 -- Amazon no longer sells this phone directly. What a pity! I guess it reflects the crazy instability in the mobile phone market. Yet I find no ready replacement or successor for it on Amazon, even setting aside the matter of price. The big battery is simply not found in any model intended for the USA market, which I hope still matters to Amazon! Heaven knows whether the phones coming from China + India are truly reliable. (It's true Motorola is just a brand for Lenovo of China, but at least the company is well adapted to selling in the USA market.) In any case, the E4 Plus X1775 can be found elsewhere online in American outlets like Best Buy as Newegg. (Yes, there's still a bit of competition for Amazon or there. Long may it continue, for everyone's sake -- even dare I say it, for Jeff Bezos & Co! Read the sci-fi novel \""\""Immortal Life\""\"" by Stanley Bing to see what I mean. It's available on Amazon  the company's original core business of selling physical books).\"";"""	0.1	11.3
B072ZWCKP5	5	I'm in Love with the Battery Life & Durablity I just upgraded from the Moto G that lasted without fail for 4 years. The Moto G phone had been left in hot vehicles (repeatedly) and dropped and the phone quality, buttons and features all held up. When it was time to switch to another phone to get 4G speed I looked at the Moto line. First, you can't beat the price. Second, it's made by Lenovo a high quality computer company (they bought out IBM). Third, The quality will blow your mind and make you wonder why anyone is buying $1,000 phones. My boss gave me a Samsung and the battery life is 3/4 of a day. Moto E4 Plus lasts for 3 days without charging! 3 days. Full Disclosure: I use this unlocked phone on the Verizon network. 1;	0.1	2.7
B072ZWCKP5	5	Goodbye forever, Samsung! Got this for 102 bucks on a deal, but it's worth the current going rate of $180 all day long. After a decade of Samsung flagship Galaxy phones, it's so nice to have a lasting battery that won't essentially turn into a landline phone after a year due to crappy batteries. Performance slower than my S6 Edge Plus by a bit, and I'll have to start bringing a small camera with me again for important pictures (on vacations, etc.) since this camera is lacking. No more useless and unremovable Samsung or AT&T apps hogging space and wasting my time, no more high deductible phone insurance needed. Maybe men want paper thin phones for their pockets, but I'm so glad I found a big battery that lasts 2 days with regular use, don't mind that it's slightly heavier and thicker, after putting on a decent protective case you don't really notice anyway. So glad a good American company like Motorola is giving us options finally. 1;	0.0	4.0
B072ZWCKP5	5	Using since January 2018: Great Battery life and works fine with ATT Sim When I moved to the US this January, I did not know that my phone would be incompatible with US carrier bands. I had to look for a phone that offers a lot of battery life, has a fast enough processor so that it does not hand and has sufficient memory and a decent camera. Moto E Plus offered exactly that. I wanted 64 GB but my budget was limited. I chose an unlocked phone (since I might switch my network in future) and put an AT&T Sim, which is working as expected. The battery almost never dies, I charge my phone like once in 5 days or so. My phone does hang, but very rarely, probably twice since I bought. Decent camera, both front and back, but frankly, I don't care much about it. I had to download File Manager, as it was not an inbuilt feature. If you are an android user, the experience would be seamless. A perfect budget phone. CAUTION: It is a large phone, and if you add any protective casing, it will be heavy. 1;	0.1	3.7
B072ZWCKP5	5	I love this phone I love this phone! I have ATT gophone plan and the only issue I had was my Sim chip in my old phone was not a nano size (of which is what this phone takes.) I took it to ATT and they gave me a nano sim chip for 5$ and literally downloaded the ATT free app and all my record came over to this new phone (Moto E.) It is great, easy to set up looks and acts like a 400+ dollar phone... I have no complaints here. Coming from a girl that lives on a budget this was great! And let me tell you...the camera is wonderful with the front flash. 1;	0.7	5.0
B072ZWCKP5	5	So happy I bought this phone I'd been using my old droid for about 3 years, and was only getting a few hours out of the battery. Not wanting to spend 600+ dollars on a phone through my carrier, I decided to look at the amazon phones. This phone is fantastic. The screen looks beautiful, and it has all the features I need. I can listen to my podcasts, email, go on facebook, and text. Since it only has 16 GB of memory, I have been uploading my photos to amazon photo to save room on my device. I will look into getting the sd card if I need extra storage. Amazing phone for the price!! 1;	0.4	4.5
B072ZWCKP5	5	Extremly Happy This phone is great! Loving it. Display is nice size. Battery is great (so far). Response and performance is very good. Very impressed. If all continues, I'll never pay $999 for a new phone. For the price of this device for a brand new phone, this is a great purchase. One thing. I could not use existing SIM card from old S6. Had to go to Sprint store to get comparable SIM. No problem with that. Over all. Extremly happy with this phone. 1;	0.5	9.7
B072ZWCKP5	5	Fantastic Budget Phone Yes a budget phone, this is not crammed full with fancy octocore processors but it is crammed with a YUGE battery, this thing will go for 2-3 days pretty easily (probably 4 with light use) and I love it! The screen is lower on the resolution side but is still looks great and is easy to see (my mom loves it) and the battery is absolutely impressive and the fact that you can remove the back plate to add your own SD card is amazing. Camera is probably the worst part about this but it still works. 1;	0.4	2.1
B072ZWCKP5	5	Awesome Cell Phone!! If you want the most out of 5000mAH battery this cell phone has it and last for hours for chatting and calling!! The phone is top notch for me!!

B072ZWCKP5	5	The Battery Life!!!! I really like this phone. The interface is really easy to use and the screen is very crisp and clear. The camera surpasses what I need/use it for.

B074P5FMG5	5	Sony quality, Sony performance! This is the first new (not 1-2 seasons ago) phone that I have bought in almost 13 years. I can't say enough about the picture and music quality for streaming. I have always been a fan of Sony phones since the release of the first Walkman phone they released with att/cingular cellular. The selfie camera alone on this phone takes amazing pictures but I am getting quality shots like never before with any other phone which is great because we do a lot of hiking and camping and lake time and it doesn't make since to us to carry a huge camera around for awesome pictures. The phone with minimal use gets 3-4 days of battery and even when streaming or heavy use sti gets a full 2+ days. The quality I have always seen from Sony phones is here with the performance that makes me laugh at those who pay 2-3 times as much for inferior phones. Best buy I have made in quite some time. 1;	0.1	3.1
B074P5FMG5	5	Best phone off 2017 This phone is fantastic. Build quality is excellent. The camera is good, and low light performance is adequate. The super store motion only really works in bright light though. Unfortunately, Sony in their infinite wisdom decided to disable the fingerprint reader for US version. This is solvable if you can figure out flashing with UK or Central Europe Firmware. Once you have the fingerprint reader enabled, this is the best phone you can get for $550, hands down (Early 2018). 1;	0.5	4.3
B074P5FMG5	5	SUPERIOR PHONE!! I love this phone!! I did my research, plenty of comparison, and it absolutely paid off! Battery lasts a considerable amount of time, I can usually go a whole day, with my usage (high), off of one charge.

B074VFRKZG	5	Pleasantly surprised I honestly wasn't sure I'd like this phone but, my old phone was about dead and I couldn't justify spending $$$($) on a new phone. I'm happy to say I really like this phone!!! Even though it came out in 2016/17, it updated to Android Pie out of the box (actually updated about 5 consecutive times to get to Pie). I'm still getting regular security updates, which is great; hope they continue. The only negative, if you can call it that, is since the back is glass, it is very heavy. I like the size which is only slighty larger than my last phone (2013 Nexus 5). Most phones from the last several years are huge Phablets and I absolutely didn't want one of those! So far, no complaints! 1;	0.3	4.8
B074VFRKZG	5	"Great value but quit after 6 wks for no reason \**UODATED REVIEW This phone quit working for no reason after 6 weeks of use. Seriously disappointing. Don't waste your money. Took it to TMobile and they advised the inside was fried. I let the battery run all the way down one time and that was enough to wreck the phone. The tech at Tmobile tried every trick in the book to restart it and nothing worked. *Original review I like this phone a lot. It is not complicated to figure it out. It has great storage space. The only thing I miss from my old Samsung is the \""\""schedule a text message\""\"" feature. Other than that I've got everything I need\"" 1;"""	-0.1	5.8
B074VFRKZG	5	Inexpensive, good processor, great photos. My husband had this phone and I have been using a Samsung galaxy s8+. I tried another cheaper phone but was unhappy. This Motorola on the other hand, was still inexpensive but the processor is good enough for what I need. HEY GUYS IT RUNS MARCH OF EMPIRES WITHOUT SUPER LAG!! aka: you can unshielded without worrying about freezing up if you're attacked. This is a requirement i need in a phone. Sure, it isnt as fast as the s8+, but daaaang, for a fraction of the price, its pretty epic. Smaller screen than im used to, but it's good quality and works well. I cant complain at all! Buy this thing!! Lol Also, play March of Empires. Come to 202. ;) 1;	0.3	7.6
B074VFRKZG	5	In the age of $1,000 phones this one is a gem. I've had Samsung Notes and Ss.... no more. I can't bring myself to pay close to or over $1,000 for a phone. No, I am not signing up for monthly payments, etc. The answer, this phone. It does everything I need it to do. No frills no thrills. It's a smart phone. The camera that is bundled with the phone leaves a bit to be desired but this can be overcome by downloading Open Camera. 1;	0.1	3.8
B074VFRKZG	5	great phone This Moto X4 is my best phone ever. It has terrific battery life and fast response time. Also I love, love, love the fingerprint sensor!

B074VFRKZG	5	Great Phone at a Reasonable Price So I'm the kind of person who doesn't mind buying technology that's a couple of years old, i.e., I don't need the latest gadgets. And I can save a lot of money that way, especially when it comes to cell phones. I had purchased a Motorola Droid Turbo 2 a couple of years ago, my second Android phone (I've given up on the overpriced iPhones). The DT2 was a nice upgrade from my previous Android, a Samsung Galaxy Mini S4, with a better camera. Unfortunately, that DT2 phone didn't last too long. Started having problems with the battery draining too fast, and I got the vertical green lines that seems to plague some DT2 phones. However, I really liked the phone and was seriously thinking of buying another DT2 to replace it. I took a look at some of the other Motorola models out there, though (I like Motorola because of the Moto Actions that allow you to turn on the flashlight or the camera with a flick of the wrist, without having to unlock or turn on the screen), and found the Moto X4. Since it was less than $150, I decided to give it a try, and I'm very glad I did. Switching over the phone to my existing carrier was easy, all I had to do was move the SIM card and the 32GB memory card from my DT2 over to the new phone and I was up and running right away, didn't even have to go into Verizon. The Moto X4 is much better than the DT2, with longer battery life and a better camera. I can go a whole day on a single charge. If I charge it up to 100% before I go to bed, it's still at 96% by the time I get up the next morning. And the operating system upgrades itself, i.e., it started off with Oreo (8.0), but over the course of several days, it began installing upgrades until it's now at Pie (9.0), and all of the monthly security updates are loaded. One feature I really like is the fingerprint sensor. It is so easy, now, to unlock my phone, especially since I use my phone for work and my company requires strong security options to be selected, like long passwords. With the DT2, I had to enter an eight character password every time I wanted to unlock the screen, a real PITA. I had to also enter a PIN every time I opened up Outlook or Skype. On the Moto X4, I just press my finger or thumb on the fingerprint sensor and it opens up right away. No more entering passwords for either my phone or my apps (for the ones that support fingerprint authorization instead of a password or PIN). Even the Starbucks app allows me to use my fingerprint instead of typing a password. One thing that still trips me up is that the power and volume control buttons are backwards from the DT2, i.e., on the DT2, the power button is on top with the volume controls below it. On the Moto X4, the volume buttons are at the top and the power button below. So I find myself turning up the volume a lot of times instead of turning off the phone. The Moto X4 uses a USB-C cable instead of the more ubiquitous USB mini plug. The phone does come with a USB-C cable, but I ended up buying several extra so I would have one in my car, my bedroom, my backpack, etc. I also bought an extra charging block, and you want to make sure you buy one that supports Quick Charge 2 or 3 if you want to take advantage of the TurboPower feature (I got the Anker Quick Charge 3.0 unit). Probably the one thing I miss from the DT2 is the wireless charging. I wish Motorola would make that feature available on more of their models. 1;	0.1	12.0
B074VFRKZG	5	The perfect phone for me. I use cricket wireless at 35.00/month for 2gb 4g. I upgraded from a Cat S40 smartphone that was durable, but was slow in nearly every other way. Perhaps it's because i came from such a dull phone that i'm so enamored with this one. I suppose that may be important for some to consider. Compared to my old phone, this is super fast, user intuitive, and has plenty of storage for my needs. I doubt i've ever met my data limit, but i have a feeling that with this phone i may be using data far more. I receive a much stronger signal from both my carrier and from my wifi. (i can finally pull up youtube videos on the phone from my detached garage whereas my old phone simply couldn't maintain a strong enough signal.) The camera is far and away better and the finger print scanner seems to work flawlessly. It's only been a few days, so i can't speak to durability. As of now, I'd recommend this phone for people like me....the people who make calls, text, occasionally browse the news sites and fb...but don't utilize their phone for heavy applications. 1;	0.1	4.7
B074VFRKZG	5	Great Phone regardless of low price. This phone does it all at a unbelievably reasonable price. I added a 256 g micro card also. I purchased it for my wife to replace her 2 1/2 year old expensive Pixel that needed constant charging. This beats the Pixel as far as we are concerned. I was an IT tech before retiring and I appreciate the value and quality. I've been using a Moto G5 Plus for 3 years which is longer than any of my $900 + phones and am still very satisfied. I'm a Verizon customer and set up was a breeze. Insert Sim card and you are on your way. I've had numerous Galaxies that all failed after a couple of years. 1;	0.4	5.8
B074VFRKZG	5	Great deal at $150 Very good phone for the price. I paid ~$200 for my first X4 and have been using for about 7 months. I just purchased another here on Amazon for $150 because of the great price. This phone is noticeably heavier than the moto G phones my family uses and was going to purchase a new G6, but could not beat the price of $150 in April 2019. I don't think Motorola is continuing to make the model X, so get it when you can at his price. 1;	0.2	1.9
B074VFRKZG	5	Great phone and hardware I love the fast charge, water/dust rating, screen, and pretty much all of it. I don't like some parts of the OS like trying to connect to the PC requires me to disable the security lock. You can disable or remove much of the programs ( doesn't have a lot of bloatware). Overall, I would definitely get another x4 if my current one dies. 1;	0.0	2.2
B074VFRKZG	5	So far so good. We got this phone for my husband. It's a huge improvement over his last phone. If you're a Verizon customer, you may want to plan on stopping by the store as soon as you get the phone unless you already have a sim card. My husband set up the phone, and then we stopped by the store to get our free sim card. By the time we got home, the phone was working. 1;	0.1	1.9
B074VFRKZG	5	Best value even in Dec 2018 Great value, smooth performance. Android pie coming. Shape and size is perfect. Material is top notch.

Other than some very minor blemishes, the phone is in great condition and full working order. I was especially pleased to find that the battery had been replaced with a new one, as the phones Battery Health indicator says the batteries condition/capacity is 100%. I also received a new lightning cord as well as a charging adapter. There was however, a single dead pixel in the center of the screen, which is not an issue to me especially considering this unit received a new battery. Would recommend. 1;	0.4	4.0

B0751RGH6W	5	IPHONE SE - 32GB - UNLOCKED - REFURBISHED Apple iPhone SE 32 GB Factory Unlocked, Space Gray (Certified Refurbished) Good day all! I finally decided to upgrade my IP5 - Cause I started to notice the updated apps straining the phone and certain processes started to feel laggy/sluggish. After some research and a lot! of comparison. I really appreciated and leaned on picking the iPhone SE. The refurbished model I got was Flawless and significantly cheaper than the newer flagship releases while the power it packs is significant for my use and application. I don't do mobile gaming (that's what my consoles and gaming pc are for) - I do some casual photos and videos but nothing professional grade. The size of the phone is PERFECT! it's not obnoxiously douchey like the huge screens of today (I thought we were trying to make tech smaller? not bigger? anyway just personal preference) ***Things I like about the iPhone SE: *** - Size - perfect for my use/need. - Power - still significant in 2018 - all apps and IOS 11.4 running smooth (compared to my older iPhone 5) - Camera - decent for casual use, it's all I need. If you want a proper images, get a proper camera. - Audio - it's decent, I primarily use headphones, so it's good for me - HEADPHONE JACK - I mean c'mon right? I feel sad for those who conformed and accepted not having a built-in 3.5mm headphone jack... cause why? cause apple said so? c'mon that's clearly a BS design flaw/oversight that they tried to re-sell. - Storage - opted for the 32GB, only cause IF they do release a newer SE model... I would like to be in a position to upgrade. Also again for my use I don't really need a beefy storage, I always back up and offload my videos/photos anyway. ***Things I don't like*** - I don't like how it made me save more than 25% of cost of owning a newer iphone or samsung, etc. (joke) - I don't like how, for the price and age of this phone, the technology and power it provides is still significant in 2018. (joke) - I don't like that it still has a old-school 3.5mm headphone jack so I can use any headphones w/o having to carry an extra dongle. (joke) - This phone sucks! LOL! (jokes of course) Notes: Phone use vary from preferrence / use / application - Do your own research and look at all your options - find a device that has a good balance for all your needs while thinking of usage for the next couple years (1-5yrs). Good luck and enjoy! 1;	0.1	13.5

B07536MYBQ	5	After two years, it still feels like a brand new phone! Bought this used for $270 on Amazon. Owned the phone for less than a week but I'm very impressed. (Probably new-toy syndrome.) Too easy to set up with Ting... just dropped a 128GB microSD card and the SIM card into it. Initial setup was, as always, easy with Android. I flashed Android Pie onto it with no issues, although I had to do it with ODIN as opposed to Smart Switch or Kies because I found out Samsung disabled this feature from both programs (server-side, so older versions will not work). It is physically a very sleek phone. It also feels very sleek... and slippery, and a huge fingerprint magnet. After I cleaned off my grubby paw prints, I slapped a case onto it. The screen itself is rather large and very generous with space. I have smaller hands but I can still comfortably (barely) use gesture typing with just my thumb. I am not a stylus user but trying... the stylus fits neatly into its slot at the bottom right of the phone. The phone's performance is... well, brand new. I can't get it to lag (yet). I'm not a super power user and like to keep things simple, so I haven't tested any crazy 3D gaming yet. (I've included my app list below, just to give you an idea of what I run on this thing.) It's nice to finally have a phone that keeps up with me. The camera is beautiful so far. I haven't used it as much as I want to yet but I have faith this will be better than my broken camera on my S7 Edge. Plenty of options in the app... nice, sharp, and colorful! Call quality seems fine... not tinny, not terrible, good to go. Network connectivity to WiFi is as fast as any of my laptops. Haven't tested tethering or anything like that yet. More to follow as I play around with it! - - Gmail - Disa - Hangouts - WhatsApp - Google Maps - Here WeGo - Adobe Lightroom - GoPro - Google Photos - SJCAM - Google Chrome - Netguard - Tasker - Timely - Aldiko Classic - Amazon Kindle - Amazon Music - Dropbox - Duolingo - YouTube UPDATE 20190906: Still pretty happy with the phone. Delved into VR use... it is pretty nice considering the battery drain while using it isn't as bad as my Galaxy Edge S7, plus it is fun to use! (Don't bother with the 2016 version of the Samsung Gear... it will mar any screen protectors and it is a super-tight fit with the connector AND the other side.) No lag so far with what I've used for Oculus Apps. One thing that drives me nuts is that I tend to take unintentional screenshots by just trying to hit the Power button or trying to lower the volume but reaching a bit too low on the left side. Pretty long battery life. Lasts me a full day and has more than 30% left with my normal use. 1;	0.2	15.0
B07536MYBQ	5	Not a smartphone it's intelligentphone! The reason I bought note 8 was for the pen. I love/do digital art and I have tried A LOT but absolutely NOTHING can beat this phone when it comes to digital art! Because of this phone I now find it hard to draw on paper! Can't live without an undo button anymore! ( I use artflow) As for the system obviously it's the best, easiest, nicest! I can find any app I dream about on Google app and most of them are free! I love playing games, working, calling, texting and sleeping on my note 8! After almost a year of use I cracked the screen, it's just cosmetic I'm still using it. however when I draw and the pen passes over a crack sometimes it thinks that I pulled my hand up and it cuts the line and that's really annoying but it's my fault, I should've used screen protector. I might move to note 9 and pass it over to my husband since he doesn't use the pen at all. 1;	0.1	4.1
B07536MYBQ	5	Great quality refurbished phone I took a chance and purchased a refurbished, unlocked phone and, as of Day 1, and very pleased. It came in an original box, with plastic wrapped charger and cables, and looks brand new. No obvious physical damages. A sticker on the outside of the box says the device has been inspected by Amazon and meets specification. The device is also so far functioning very well. I took it to an AT&T store and had it set up within 30 min, including some chit chat with the cute customer service rep who helped me. I told him that it was a refurbished, unlocked phone. He checked some numbers and said everything looked legit. There really is nowhere but up from my old, slow, make me want to throw it out of a window, Galaxy Note 5. If my new Note 8 continues to please, I might become loyal refurbished phone convert. I did some research before buying my first refurb and found out that most of these phones are returned due to problems that don't significantly affect functionality. You can of course never know, but considering the fact that the Note 8 is water-resistant, I think there are probably a very small number of major issues that are fixable and would have caused it to disappoint its previous owner. If it was a significant major issue, other than water damage, I assume that it couldn't be fixed. Anyway, this has been my experience as of Day 1. If trolls start jumping out of the battery in a month, once it's no longer returnable, I'll post an update. 1;	0.0	6.6
B07536MYBQ	5	Works on the Verizon network through total Wireless. I upgraded from a note 4 to this. The difference is night and day. The phone responds so much faster and with 5 layers/options for biometric security it really shows how much ahead of the electronics curve Samsung is with their phones.

B07536MYBQ	5	Gorgeous phone, no security seals on box Just got my Note. Had an issue with delivery but finally arrived. There were no seals on the box which made me panic a bit but all seems to be in order. This is a gorgeous device and I've always wanted to come back to a Note series since my old Note 2. I remember seeing an unboxing video that showed that a clear case came in the box but mine didn't, from what I see that's normal. If any issues pop up I'll be updating my review. 1;	0.2	2.9
B07536MYBQ	5	Just possibly the finest smart phone ever made! This phone is F A S T. Zoom. I know, iPhoners cover their ears and sing na na na nah. My son is one who prefers IPhones and we compared the two new phones based on independent reviews and comparative photos. Even he agreed. The Samsung Note 8 just takes better photos. But as school he's cool with an iPhone. On the dark side Samsung's lack of thorough instructions left me scratching my head. So I headed down to T Mobile and some young woman installed the simm card and SD card so fast I don't know how she did it. So I think Samsung should spend some time providing more instructions. They just don't. I'm graduating from a Note 4 and expect better photos than the 4 and a faster operating system. It is easy to use and programs easily as well. It has more RAM so it won't log jam easily. Considering the price tab I opted for a Otter glass shield and a slick carry case to protect it when it slips and falls. 1;	0.1	5.6
B07536MYBQ	5	Truly Exeptionally Beautiful Phone Perfect latest smart phone. All Glass interior is really breathtaking; don't think any of the pictures really does it justice.

B07536MYBQ	5	This Note 8 is great! N1 Wireless sold this to me and described it “Like New”. I am very satisfied with the quality of the product and the price. So far, it works just fine and works well with the AT&T SIM card I took out of my iPhone. I have LTE and visual voicemail. The phone updated and I will be going to Romania in a few days and hope to get the PIE update there, as well. There were some tiny scratches on the screen and it didn’t come with a leather case as the description mentioned, just a cheap rubber one. The charger was a Samsung look-alike that didn’t fast charge and prompted an error message, but I put that aside so the device wouldn’t be damaged. S pen works great. Overall, satisfied and happy. Will monitor battery life and perhaps update. Got my like new Nomad case from E B_Y seller Intermarine 2013 for 5 dolliz! Wow! Works in Romania, too. See second pic. 1;	0.3	8.1
B07536MYBQ	5	Love this phone. Was an avid iPhone user for a while (they have better accessibility that I'm a -huge- fan of), but decided to switch back to Android after seeing the new Note8 commercials. As an artist, I love the S Pen and all of the art apps that you just can't find for iOS devices. I was originally wary of the size (I usually prefer smaller phones), but the one hand mode makes using this phone a breeze. Bixby (Samsung's assistant) comes with an xp system and leaderboard that makes me actually want to utilize this feature (something I didn't do much with Siri). I also love that getting this phone through Amazon was cheaper than going through my mobile carrier or from Samsung directly. All in all, great buy! 1;	0.5	5.4

B075FKVJV3	5	The Nokia 2 is an amazing value for the right application SUMMARY: This is a amazing phone for the money, but only if you don't need many apps or require high performance. According to the reviews here everyone either loves or hates this phone, which made it difficult for me to decide if it was right for me. It turns out to be perfect but I'm using it as a 2nd phone for travel; it would NOT work as my primary phone. The difficulty with this phone is insufficient memory and storage space, as others have pointed out. Today it was running slowly and I tried to send a picture via MMS and it failed. Turns out I'm running out of storage already. I was able to uninstall some apps and move others to the SD card to get it working well again, but I still have less than 1GB to spare. Everything else about this phone is better than I expected for what I paid ($100) and it's so nice to never have to worry about the battery dying! This review is for the TA-1035-B. I notice earlier versions are selling for even cheaper but I can't vouch for those. BTW if you have a little extra to spend, my primary phone is a Moto G5 Plus which I found for only $150 and is a nice upgrade in every way from my previous phone which cost almost $1000! (Galaxy S6) There's just no reason to spend that much for a phone any more. 1;	-0.1	5.2
B075FKVJV3	5	A Solid Budget Device I purchased this for my wife to replace a Nokia Lumia 521. She uses it primarily for phone and text, and taking pictures. It is a perfectly adequate device for her needs (and is reviewed in that context). Coming from the unsupported Windows Phone ecosystem, it was also a nice perk to install a few home automation apps on the new phone. This device will not win any awards for speed, but in this case, that isn't an issue. It calls, it texts, it takes pictures. Switching between apps is a little slow, but not annoyingly so. It is pretty much stock Android (as of this review, it is running Android 7.1.1, 8.1 is in beta for the device but I won't subject my spouse to beta testing). The build quality of the device is top notch. It feels more like a mid-range device than a budget handset (especially compared to the old Lumia 521). The screen is clear and sharp. I added a basic case and screen protector to the phone just in case. Storage is definitely a compromise. After installing updates, about 3 GB of 8 GB were still free. If you want to install apps or take pictures, you'll want a microSD card. Fortunately we had one from her old phone, so that wasn't any extra cost at this time. Overall, this is a solid budget device, and I definitely recommend it. Pros: -Low cost -Stock Android -Receives Android updates -Good build quality -Decent battery life -Nice screen Cons (this is a budget device and these are definitely not dealbreakers): -A little slow -Low storage 1;	0.3	8.9
B075FKVJV3	5	Perfect Entry Level Smartphone for Seniors and Young Teens For $100.00 in 2018, I think this is the budget phone to beat. Let me emphasize, this is a entry level smartphone, but the build quality is great. I have a OnePlus 5 myself and was very surprised how well the Nokia 2 compared when I unboxed it. I bought two of these for my parents at Christmas and they've had no issues with them running on T-Mobile. My daughter's hand-me-down Nexus 5 recently tanked and I just can't see spending much more than this on a phone for a teen. To me, excellent battery life and continued updates is more important than a little extra ram or faster processor. I considered the Amazon Moto e4 or e4 Plus, but those are towards the end of their life cycle and are never going to see Android 8.0. The Nokia 2 is at least slated to receive 8.1. Pros: - Cost - Great screen picture (no its not AMOLED etc... but were talking $100 phone here) - Very good call quality on T-Mobile, have yet to setup daughters phone on AT&T but will update once done - Large batttery - Dual Sim - Expandable Memory - Vanilla Android, not heavily skinned - Update to at least Android 8.1 Cons: - Sluggish Performance - Built in 8gb memory is over 1/2 gone as soon as you start up the phone - OK camera 1;	0.2	5.6
B075FKVJV3	5	Best Budget Phone Bought it on sale during prime day for $80.00. For that price I give it 5 stars. Even at it's original price of $100 I would have given it a 4/5. Phone can handle android. Some apps and settings take a few seconds longer to load. This is because of a older processor and only 1gb of ram. I would complain if this phone wasn't so cheap. For a budget phone costing this price, you get what you pay for. The battery size is also a nice addition. If you watch a lot of youtube videos or other streaming sites you will have a lot of time to watch videos. The battery life is quite impressive. I also think the build quality of the phone is nice and professional. This phone also has cameras that will suffice in any circumstance. They are not the best cameras but you will be able to clearly see whatever you take a photo of. There is also a flash on the back which can double as a flashlight. For the $100 price point and under there are few phones that can come close to this value. 1;	0.1	7.3
B075FKVJV3	5	Excellent device Excellent phone/device. There is no reason, other than chutzpah, to spend more than $100 for a communications device. Buy this and use the $900 you save to do something fun. (Unless you really care if your friends judge you for not having the latest iPh). 1;	0.2	1.8
B075FKVJV3	5	Very, very good buy! Great phone for $100. It's a little slow, but with having Android 7.1.1 and with all the features, it can't be beat. Unbelievable. And Nokia, a Swedish company is well known and respected.. 1;	0.5	3.1

B075FKVJV3	5	Great value, awesome battery life! This is a great, simple, long lasting phone. If you want a high powered smart phone, don't get this, but if you want something that can handle simple things (like phone calls, text, Facebook, etc.) then this is a great phone (even though a bit slow with Facebook). It not good for games, of course, and it doesn't have an amazing camera (although not too bad either). I got it simply because we needed another phone for phone calls and this has a great price. 1;	0.6	3.9
B075FKVJV3	5	Great phone for the price Great phone for the price! Why pay too much for basically the same smartphone from the other guys? The Nokia 2 unlocked 8GB Smartphone works great and I am looking forward to carrying it to Europe with me next year so I will not have to pay the inflated international roaming charges of those other cell service providers. You can add a micro sd card to expand the memory if you wish, no worries. For what I need this phone for it more than serves the purpose. This smartphone gets two thumbs up! 1;	0.4	4.0
B075FKVJV3	5	Just a decent, basic Smartphone! I was looking an inexpensive Smartphone with hotspotting capability to use with a GSM based wireless provider (Mintsim). This product checked almost all the boxes. Ram is limited, but storage can swell nicely with addition of SD card. Camera is basic, processor just adequate. No usb OTG. Battery life is very good with no need to charge daily. I just wish it were smaller like iphone 5 or se, but I guess I am out numbered in my desire for a smaller Android Smartphone here in the US. 1;	0.2	3.9
B075FKVJV3	5	Good general use phone. Smaller size that slides into my pocket easily. I'm not a power user, so the processor speed is more than adequate. The only negative is that the screen is not as sharp as some of the premium phones, but on the bright side, I saved $300-$900. 1;	0.2	2.1

B075FKVJV3	5	Excellent phone for $100 Based on the value of this phone, I give it a solid five stars. It obviously doesn't have the most powerful processor, but it runs Android 7.1 quite smoothly, if not as speedily as phones with better specs. I've heard complaints that it lags, but it's not enough to bother me in the slightest. My only previous experience with Android is with a couple of small tablets over the years (Nexus and Amazon Fire), and this thing runs circles around those. Even with the cost of adding a Micro SD card, it's a huge bargain. I replaced my aging Windows 10 phone with this Nokia, added the Microsoft launcher, a 64GB memory card, and a few apps that I need, and I'm ready to roll. The fact that it's Nokia was a huge selling point for me. Even though the phones are made by HMD Global, I'm sure Nokia wouldn't put their name on crap. When you pick it up, you can just tell that it's well made. It feels solid in the hand, with just enough heft. And from what I've read, Nokia will be rolling out Android updates as they're available, unlike a lot of other manufacturers. Full disclosure: I'm on my second unit of this phone, the first one wouldn't recognize the SD card I had installed. The seller replaced it with zero hassle, and this one doesn't have that issue. 1;	0.0	5.4

You can't even own your own pictures as you have to sign into Google and be in agreement to even delete a picture! Which is why I'm trying to find a good older BB right now that has no Google or Windows. Anyone though comfortable with Google and all it's apps, this is perfect.

B075FL4H89	5	Cute, fits in any pocket with ease and gets the job done! UPDATE!** This phone is not charging. I had it on for 2 weeks maybe charged only 3 times and now it won’t charge. The phone will not come on. Not happy right now. I stand out with this phone. It's noticeable. Sleek. I got the one in orange and love it. My Nokia 3310 3G is my little nostalgic phone. I learnt all the features in one night. So it's your basic simple go to phone to disconnect from all the social media frenzy that comes with a smart phone. The battery holds up fine but I haven't started making calls much with it. The Bluetooth connected with my iphone perfect! I was able to transfer my favourite contacts from my iphone to my nokia's contact list. Interchangeable texting from predictive to multiple tapping. The ringtones are loud and suiting. I love, love, love this phone. 1;	0.2	10.4
B075FL4H89	5	Excellent Alternative to a Smartphone I purchased the Nokia 3310 3G about half a year ago because I wanted to see if I could survive without taking my smartphone everywhere. And I have grown to love it since then. This phone is very boring, and that is probably the best complement I could give it. I have found no temptation whatsoever to pull it out and scroll through social media or read the news as I was waiting in line or having a conversation, which forces me to live in the real world. It's great for phone calls and texting, and not much else. The battery life lasts many times longer than my smartphone did, as well. Obviously, the camera on this device is capable of taking a photo for reference or remembering something, but it would not be a good idea to use it for any artistic purposes as it is of rather low quality. I have found that this has helped me to enjoy beautiful sunsets and scenery without worrying about trying to get a good picture to share. The signal reception on this phone seems to be about as good as any other phone I have used, and it has not really been a problem. The physical design is relatively sturdy, and I have not had any major problems with it (although the plastic back has gotten scratched up from daily use). It is much smaller than a smartphone, and it fits in my hand or pocket easily. The user interface doesn't seem to just be a copy of cheap phones from the past decade; I believe it is actually much better designed for ease of use and quickly accessing important options, and I think it looks rather nice. (It also doesn't split long text messages like old dumbphones used to, which is great.) Altogether, I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for an alternative to a smartphone. 1;	0.2	7.5
B075FL4H89	5	It is great! Exactly as described, 3G, classic feel, amazing battery life, etc. This product is exactly like the old version plus twitter and instagram believe it or not! It’s pretty great! I honestly love it! I bought it to try and disconnect from my iPhone when i travel and stuff. My brother has been using it full time since his iPhone broke. It’s pretty cool. But of course, don’t expect the camera to be amazing or to have a lot of memory. It’s a classic nokia phone still. The battery’s amazing, i think he charges it like once every 3 days. It has other games aside from the snake one, which were also pretty cool for the kind of phone it is. I was worried about the signal since this phone was remade to be compatible with 3G instead of 2G since 2G is no longer used these days. But we’re already on LTE which is after 4G. So i was worried about that but the signal works great! I have no complaints at all! 1;	0.5	10.0
B075FL4H89	5	It does what it promises This phone does ALL that it advertises. The sound quality is great, the battery life is unimaginably good and its durability beats the Toyota Tacoma. I am spoiled with Google contact being synced with all my phone. Unfortunately, this phone lacks that sync. So, other than that, I really like this phone. 1;	0.2	2.7

B075FL4H89	5	Perfect phone for a simple life! I received this phone super fast! I was so happy that my Samsung android (T-Mobile, No contract) Sim card fit and I could use it right away. I am switching to a lower tech phone because I am tired of smart phones and just want more simplicity in my life; if you want to write me a novel in a text, too bad, email me! Tired of paying for data, too. Time to downgrade, save money and live a less controlled life. Would not recommend for seniors who can't see well, texting might be difficult for them. 1;	0.0	5.2

B075FL4H89	5	The best Phone-phone you can get Are you tired of smartphones? Well, this one is a fantastic compromise. Mind you, it's a pricey thing, as it's a novelty product after all, but all the things it does, it does great: by being just a phone and nothing more. --System UI--- If you're like me, and are only familiar with Windows Phone, Android and Nokia's old Symbian OS, the new user interface would take a bit of time getting used to. It's not because it's difficult to use, it's a really simple interface designed to be user friendly. Rather, it's because I had to adjust to the interface because of how relatively simple it is. Anything that's important to the practicality of a phone is provided to you in as few clicks as possible, and that's pretty awesome. WARNING, there's no Wifi. --Battery Life---- It's great. It's really great. You wouldn't have to charge this phone for upwards of a week. I really missed that. With heavy usage, it obviously goes down, but being such a simple phone, heavy usage is likely not going to be a thing. ---For those of you buying this for Nostalgia feelings--- This phone isn't going to cut it for you. The changes to the software and features, as well as the size and make of the phone (it's so thin and light) is not going to activate any kind of nostalgia you had for the original save for wondering why phones can't go back to buttons anymore. To sum up, the phone is strong, the screen vibrant and decently lit, the battery life is fantastic and you don't have to worry about bugs, being constantly connected to online noise (social networks and otherwise) or malware. The phone is very much of the Nokia quality, and for anyone who just wants a phone, or want to give someone the gift of just a phone, it's worth every penny. 1;	0.3	9.4
B075FL4H89	5	USER FRIENDLY INSTRUCTIONS IT IS A WELL BUILT CELL PHONE. MY PROBLEM WAS I HAVE A T-MOBILE PREPAID SIM CARD WITH 2000 MINUTES FOR THE 4G NETWORK; THE NOKIA 3310 USES THE 3G NETWORK. (AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I THINK WAS THE PROBLEM.) ANYWAYS I HAVE REPLACED IT WITH A NOKIA 3.1 ANDROID AND I AM ENJOYING IT (THE SIM CARD WORKS) 1;	0.2	2.4
B075FL4H89	5	Perfect Dumb Phone Got this for my Pre-teen. I didn't turn on a data plan and it doesn't connect to Wi-Fi. It makes me feel a lot better to have communication with my kid and not worry about social media and internet. 1;	0.2	2.3
B075FL4H89	5	Perfect!!! Purchased for my international travels to Jamaica. Tried a Digicel SIM card in it and it works. This is my second Nokia phone for use when I travel. First one lasted over 10 years and still going strong. It has taken a beating though so decided to replace it with this 3310 3G and once again, Nokia did not disappoint. Got the blue and I’m totally in love with it. 1;	0.4	3.5

B075FL4H89	5	Great phone I love this phone. I've owned many Nokia feature phones including the original 3310 (which still works, at least until the T-Mobile 2G network is shut down). The internet connection works well for basic internet and email with US Mobile (a T-Mobile MVNO) but I only get EDGE and not 3G apparently. I look forward very much to the 4G version of this phone, with VoLTE support for future-proofing when the 2G and 3G networks are shut down (not until at least 2020). It has all the features you need for a basic phone. I only need voice, text, and email. The battery life is impressive. A full day of use (including data) and the battery is barely depleted. The form factor is nice and small compared to the original, it disappears in your pocket. Caveats: No apparent way of silencing/changing ringer volume without going to volume settings. Needs volume rocker or Profiles. Only 3G/2G Possible accidentally pocket-dial 911 because the keyguard doesn't stop the 9 key, which lets you dial emergency numbers. Overall I highly recommend it at least until the 4G version is released. 1;	0.1	5.4

B075FW7GZV	5	32GB models are generally newer The 32GB model of the iPhone Se has only been sold by Apple since March 2017, so while the device is used it's is only months old for a substancial discount.

With one of the phones, we had to reinstall our SIM a few times and power the phone on and off a few times before it could get cell service. Our provider's help person said that is not unusual. 1;	0.3	2.5

Now I sometimes goes two days without and still don't drop below 40% even with a fair amount of talking and texting. The screen is not quite as dazzling as an S9 but honestly, once you don't have them side by side you won't even notice. The camera and the video: WOW. SO much better than the S6, probably equal to the S9 but so much easier and more intuitive to use, inc special features. 1;	0.3	2.8
B076XLLCQC	5	A superior option. Do it!! I can tell you this phone is outstanding!! No I didn't get headphones. So for this price if you don't have any, go buy some Now as far as what's in the package. A Phone, a charger with c port charging cord and a sim slot release tool. The phone came with a quality stylus (not Samsung branded) . I lost my Note 8 and decided for the first time ever. I would replace it with a outside vendor. I'm very glad I did. With 5g phones entering the market but not yet with my carrier. This was a great option. This phone works as smoothly as my original. No visible evidence of previous use. This is a great option. If you need a phone for less. Use this option. Fast delivery was also a plus. 1;	0.2	8.0
B076XLLCQC	5	Check accessories. It is in the description. Great phone but it wasn't in the box when it arrived. The phone box was opened and all the accessories and the phone were just moving around in the box. Please take more care for costumer products. People pay alot of money for it to just be thrown in a box. Phone is otherwise as advertised. Not original accessories. The charger made the phone hot so be sure and get an original one to save the life of your phone. 1;	0.0	1.8
B076XLLCQC	5	Great phone...worth the purchase! I am very happy with my purchase of the Galaxy Note 8, from the seller Chubbiestech. I have had it for about one month now, and it is working very well for me. It came with an authentic Samsung S-Pen, and was an unlocked phone like the description says. When I first turned the phone on, I could see that it perhaps was used for T- Mobile before being unlocked, and this worried me a little bit. BUT, as soon as I placed my Sim card from my old phone into the new phone, it converted the use of the phone into AT&T, which is the service that I already had, and wanted to continue with. I am very pleased with my new phone, and I am still discovering all of it's cool features! 1;	0.5	4.6
B076XLLCQC	5	Device seems brand new Device seems brand new. It worked on AT&T without an issue and has the factory unlocked firmware flashed. I'm very impressed with the phone overall. I needed the phone for work as a BYOD device. My normal phone is a Pixel 2 XL. Battery life is significantly less on the Note 8, not sure if that is due to being used or particular to the Note 8. 1;	0.2	1.7
B076XLLCQC	5	Got what i paid for. Which was good. This note 8 was more expensive than others i saw however i am pleased. Make sure you get this phone from a seller with a good rating rather than just picking the cheapest one. Mine was at least 100 more than the cheapest one i found but when i got it it was so close to brand new it still had the protective plastic wrap on the sides. I love Samsung notes and ill buy a note 9 after i get done with this one. 1;	0.2	2.1
B076XLLCQC	5	It is just like brand new! I read some other reviews on here, which made me Leary, but when i got it, It was perfect condition. It came with all of the original accessories (ie pen, charger, even some adapters) It was totally free of a provider and I just plugged in my SIM from straight talk and it worked. Plus my old phone (note4) Would not let me use mobile hotspot, bc it was att -but this one has no restrictions. Its great. I was very pleasantly satisfied. 1;	0.3	4.1
B076XLLCQC	5	Unlock phone works perfect This is exactly what I was looking for. Product came as described. I was worried that it was not unlocked. When I turned it on it showed a Carrier that was not mine. But when I installed my Carrier SIM card. It worked flawlessly and perfectly. 1;	0.1	3.1

B076XLLCQC	5	Activated on US Cellular no problem. Looks and functions like new. $350 less than buying from my carrier. Arrived 12 hours after order was placed. Happy. A worthy step up from my note 4. Not a fan of Bixby though. 1;	0.2	2.5
B076XLLCQC	5	EXCELLENT My wife loves it very reasonably priced!!! Works EXCELLENT 1;	0.9	1.9
B076XLLCQC	5	Sim Card I've been using it for three months and I'm having no issues. I highly suggest to order the case and screen protector with it. And make sure your phone provider supports GSM in order to use the sim card. I was able to use it with a Cricket Sim without issues. Battery life lasts reasonable amount of time considering the consumption. 1;	0.4	3.1

B076XLLCQC	5	Great phone, great price! Great phone, was a Christmas present for my daughter and she loves it. I don't know what other reviewers are expecting but it's a great phone at a great price. Looks brand new, factory unlocked, no additional payments on my monthly phone bill. What's not to like... Yeh it does come with generic charger and no ear buds, but who cares. Gonna be a little give and take for the price and being refurbished. Anyway, the phone works great. If you happen to be a particular individual that wants everything....well go to samsung.com and pay top dollar for a note 9. However, if you're like me and just want a late model flagship phone at a great price that works great then look no further. Sorry a bit winded. 1;	0.3	5.5
B076XLLCQC	5	So far so good Works as expected, the phone I received did have a few spots where the paint had been scraped off, looks like it probably happened when they were taking it apart to refurbish it. Havent had any issues with it, the only thing I could even complain about it that it seems like the battery life is a bit shorter than I would expect but given its a year old phone, that's probably to be expected. 1;	0.5	1.6
B076XLLCQC	5	Good as new! mostly phone came with charger, phone looks pristine, only complaint is the s-pen seems third party with a wonky tip, so gonna have to order a replacement, as it's response is intermittent. other thing of note is this was the t-mobile version. but ran the imei to verizon and they said i could activate it through them. will update as time goes on. 1;	0.2	2.2
B076XLLCQC	5	Perfect in every way! I love the Note 8 and this unlocked version is quite impressive. No need to worry about bloatware and every feature works as intended on my carrier plan. Though this is a refurbished phone, there is no indication that it is not straight from the assembly line. I did not receive the manufacturer's adapter for charging nor headphones but it is not a problem for me. The phone is as advertised and I am thrilled to own it at the price I paid for it. I previously owned 2 AT&T Note 8s and I am thoroughly impressed with this Unlocked Refurbished Note 8. It is flawless in every aspect; performance, quality, and visually stunning. 1;	0.5	6.3
B076XLLCQC	5	I love it, but when you mentioned it's Factory Unlocked I love it, but when you mentioned it's Factory Unlocked, I get Verizon logo when turning on the phone, also my charger and the AC plug are not Samsung original and no Headphone. Price was cheaper than others, otherwise, I would have returned it. I still think you should be reimbursed me $50 for selling me a Verizon phone. This is a bad advertising, it should say, Verizon Unlocked. 1;	0.0	0.9
B076XLLCQC	5	Great! Arrived 3 days before estimated delivery date. Easily activated with Sprint. Gear phone, I love the screen. Can't tell that it is refurbished! Great condition. Highly recommend!! 1;	0.4	5.2

B0774T8DC6	5	It's the best iphone ever made I ordered this one on Amazon for a friend who kept falling victim to the latest and greatest iphone trends only to end up having multiple problems that were beyond his control and rinsed for $700-$800. Aside from that, he did have a tendency to drop them, get them a bit wet.... I've had mine for 2 years, dropped it several times on the ground from my back pocket, intentionally threw it on the ground once, and accidentally submerged it in a toilet!! For a while I had to survive with a floating home button but it's back to normal now. This is a bug free, reasonably priced, rugged little phone. Read reviews elsewhere. Apple probably doesn't want you knowing that. When I finally run mine into the ground, I have another new one waiting for me in storage. It's that good of a phone. 1;	0.1	2.8
B0774T8DC6	5	The price is the best. The price is the best.I hate paying those big high prices for a cell phone. I’ve always had pretty good luck with Amazon recondition phones. This one is no different and it worked great the only thing I wish I would’ve gotten more memory on it to start with. That’s what happens when you’re cheap out on things. My fault. Works great. 1;	0.4	4.0
B0774T8DC6	5	Great buy Great phone in 2019 for $100 bucks And some chump change. I bought a locked iphone 8 plus and need something very temporary until i got some money. I now how have a iphone 8 4.7 and i loved them all the same. 1;	0.3	1.9
B0774T8DC6	5	Impressed! I have got refurbished Iphones in the past and this is the best looking one I have received! phone came a day earlier than expected! The only wear I see on ANY of the phone is the tell tale sign of an otter box protector, a faint circle around the apple logo on the back. Doesn't bother me one bit! I'm very happy with my purchase so far, and I know where I will be returning if I need a phone in the future! 1;	0.2	3.3

B0774T8DC6	5	Note that the camera isn’t all that good because it’s an SE and the phone has a few scratches I bought the SE for my son and he’s been using it for 4 months now the phone came with a few scratches on the screeen but overall the phone looked brand new it’s a good deal and I love this phone and its AMAZING!!!! 1;	0.4	0.9

B07752FPVQ	5	Genuine product , Would definitely recommend . Was hesitant at first but very much impressed by the product , there wasn’t a single scratch on the screen ,the mobile was perfect , it was amazon renewed so I wouldn’t expect anything less , it came with a screen protector and an original charger but the power cable was a third party product which wasn’t charing the mobile as expected . Have requested amazon for a replacement for the power cable I hope they get it done . I wanted to give it 4 starts because of the power cable but couldn’t help cause I’m in love with the mobile . Finally , I’d recommend you to go for it , give it a try if you don’t like what you get you could still return it and get the refund. I’ll upload the pictures soon .... 1;	0.3	2.4
B07752FPVQ	5	Beautiful, clean Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  Have it for a few hours. So far no problems. The phone came in a white box and included a generic charging adapter and USB cable. On unboxing the phone appeared pristine. There were few scratches but unless you're searching for them you'll not see them. They are barely visible. The screen was beautiful. I however did not like the hard click I had to make on home button. It had a funny feel each time I clicked it. Haven't inserted any chip in it. Overall it's a good buy. So far so good. Will update if anything happens. 1;	0.1	6.7

B077596D7L	5	It’s worth it! I am incredibly satisfied! The phone came in perfect condition! It had about an 80% of battery life upon arrival, and the phone synced from my other device smoothly. My SIM card immediately worked once I put it in. The phone came with no scratches at all, looks brand new! I think it’s worth it! The photos are great! The storage is 64g just like I ordered. It came with an adapter, phone charger, and SiIM tray ejecter. UPDATE: Two days later, I found out that I could make calls and receive them just well, but I can’t hear the person on the other line, unless it’s on speaker. Yet, they can hear me just fine. So, I contacted the seller to see if I can get a replacement. I’ll update as soon as something happens. 1;	0.3	6.0
B077596D7L	5	It was awesome I am skeptical when reading thru all the comments, but since my Nexus 6 is so slow and laggy, I decided to buy it anyway. I did a research and saw BuySpry has good review so I gave it a chance. It has been almost 1 month since I have it, and it is wonderful, running very smooth. It has a little scratch on the screen but it is acceptable for an used iPhone. My phone came with 95% battery health which is excellent. No complaint so far. POSITIVE and HAPPY with my purchase. 1;	0.6	5.4
B077596D7L	5	It’s just a brand new phone I can say it’s one of the best phone It really look like new though no headphone but it came with charger 🔌 and it’s pretty new no scratches whatsoever thanks to the seller o recommend this seller for the best phone however..... 1;	0.4	0.9

B077596D7L	5	Perfect condition (Japanese version ) some disappointing differences compared to usa versions Perfect condition phone. Only bad part about this phone is it is a Japanese model phone certain things you can't do with them .acoording to some reports and testing It has a slower LTE modem, signal strength indoors was not as good .They are programmed a little different. A1902 is the exclusive edition for the Japan market. It covers some LTE bands used only in the country Notice that the phone has a mandatory shutter sound when taking photos. 1;	-0.1	2.3
B077596D7L	5	Everything I had hoped for & Got it All !! Package arrived on schedule. The iPhone was nicely packaged in an aftermarket carton. When I opened the package I was surprised at how perfect the cosmetic condition was. Awesome !! I placed the iPhone X on the enclosed charger and the phone was at 85%. It was 100% charged in about 15 minutes. I signed on and was able to transfer all data and apps automatically from my iPad. Overall, I am very pleased with the price, packaging and performance of the iPhone X. Great Phone !! 1;	0.4	5.5

It came faster than estimated & is in perfect working & looking condition. I think it’s better than described (Renewed). The renewed status means a strong battery clean chip-less body & quick set up of the unlocked phone but this one is working like a new phone. It took only a few minutes to transfer my old android phone info to the iPhone. Better signal with much more style. The battery is better than my Android. Great price & great phone. 1;	0.5	7.0

B0775FLHPN	5	Genuine product , Would definitely recommend . Was hesitant at first but very much impressed by the product , there wasn’t a single scratch on the screen ,the mobile was perfect , it was amazon renewed so I wouldn’t expect anything less , it came with a screen protector and an original charger but the power cable was a third party product which wasn’t charing the mobile as expected . Have requested amazon for a replacement for the power cable I hope they get it done . I wanted to give it 4 starts because of the power cable but couldn’t help cause I’m in love with the mobile . Finally , I’d recommend you to go for it , give it a try if you don’t like what you get you could still return it and get the refund. I’ll upload the pictures soon .... 1;	0.3	2.4
B0775FLHPN	5	Beautiful, clean Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  Have it for a few hours. So far no problems. The phone came in a white box and included a generic charging adapter and USB cable. On unboxing the phone appeared pristine. There were few scratches but unless you're searching for them you'll not see them. They are barely visible. The screen was beautiful. I however did not like the hard click I had to make on home button. It had a funny feel each time I clicked it. Haven't inserted any chip in it. Overall it's a good buy. So far so good. Will update if anything happens. 1;	0.1	6.7

I loved the large screen & wish the Note 8 still would have it, & some of the background colors. Its a little slimmer & longer. So u can fit more on your home screen. I got the warranty just in case.

B077WSVG4Z	5	Affordable like the pixel 3a but with the benefits of the the pixel 3. I love this phone. I got it after the pixel 3 came out. From what I was researching before, it's pretty much the 3 only missing some minor things. When it came down to it, this was more affordable and only came with only a little less than a pixel 3 phone. The only downside is that now the 3a is out and it has a headphone jack, but way less things when it comes to hardware. The pixel 2 is waterproof, and has the metal body while the 3a has the plastic body and no water resistance. Haven't had a 3a myself but that's kind of a deal breaker to me considering the phone. Overall, the pixel 2 is a solid phone and I would totally recommend it. 1;	0.4	5.6

B077ZKKBDB	5	"Good phone \I've been using this phone for about two weeks now, very happy with it so far. Some reviewers complained about processor speed, but I had been using a three year old Huawei and this thing seems lightning fast to me, I'm certainly not complaining. In spite of the big screen the battery doesn't drain as fast as I expected, I've gone 48 hours between charges. Granted, I don't play cell phone games much which probably helps. Camera, has trouble with low light but actually better than other phones I've had, and in a decent light level pictures look great. There's also a little camera button on the side of the phone, so that you can turn it to landscape mode and use the button like it's a traditional camera, which is kinda neat. Cons: the only way to disable the ringer in this version of android is by turning on do not disturb, which is fine, just different. Also, this thing is a \""\""phablet\""\"" so it's... pretty big. Only just barely fits in my jacket pocket and can be kind of awkward for smaller hands. A popsocket would be a good idea.\"" 1;"""	0.2	3.9
B077ZKKBDB	5	Like a little tablet I love this phone. Keep in mind it is absolutely enormous -- a little unwieldy to use with only one hand at a time -- but big is what I was looking for, and it's perfect for me. My biggest complaint about it is that it's not popular enough (yet?) to have a lot of available cases/screen protectors, and the ones I got were complete garbage -- obviously not about the phone itself, but I could see it being a concern for some customers. Overall, I would recommend this phone for someone who likes big, sturdy phones with LOTS of battery life (I left my charger at work over the weekend, used my phone as normal, and it didn't die until late Sunday) & doesn't care TOO much about picture quality (it's not bad, per se, but the camera can be a little slow to focus, which is kind of annoying when you're trying to photograph an eight-month old kitten). 1;	0.4	3.4
B077ZKKBDB	5	My third Sony Cel Phone This is my third Sony Xperia celular phone after model Z1 and Z3Plus. This XA2 Plus Model fulfills all my needs and more. With the additional advantage of a fantastic bigger size screen. I use my phone for my usual every day needs, storage, photos, calculations, files, storage and more and it satisfies me completely. I dont pretend the best in the field of celular phones and this Sony model brings me the possibility of changing from my model to the next with an easy transfer procedure of all my information. By the way I add that all my electronics ítems in my house are Sony. That is TV sets, Tablet and more.

B077ZKKBDB	5	A Solid Phone with a Solid Battery I am impressed with this phone, for it is very well manufactured, has a great detail, and appears expensive. The screen is beautiful once you get to set up the display and its color gamut in the settings. The sound is awesome, and the microphone works perfectly, for I no longer have to have people ask me to repeat what I have previously said. The first main feature of this phone is its camera, and it definitely takes good photos. While other phones have good cameras, in reality, it is the software the allows the pictures to come out looking nicely. With other phones, when you transfer your photos onto a computer, they do not look quite as good. With Xperia, however, the pictures look amazing, the the detail sure beats some of the major phones I have recently used. I will not go back to iPhone or Samsung after this guy. After all, Sony provides numerous other phone makers with their camera setup, so I am pleased with the pictures and the quality. The second important aspect of this phone is its battery. I have had this guy for about 6 months. I try to charge my battery up to 92-98%. I almost never let it go to 100%. What I have noticed in comparison to other phones, is that I can get 4 days out of one charge when doing phone calls, using Bluetooth, texting, taking photos, etc. The battery lasts no matter how much you force it to be used. The only thing that may drain it quickly is having the location turned on and having the screen brighter than it should be. The stamina mode is also very impressive, so anyone can be happy with this phone. In my opinion, it has already outperformed iPhone and Samsung just due to a better battery. On a final note, I was able to buy two of these phones, and I still had paid less than the price of one phone made by iPhone or Samsung. I appreciate Sony for not asking too much for high quality and durability. 1;	0.3	9.5
B077ZKKBDB	5	Great improvement from what I had before Sony what can I say. I read good reviews about this phone. Mayor complain was the size. The size is great and I have seen phones at about the same size. The fingerprint location is the best, You can add you 2 index fingers so no matter which hand you use, you can always unlock your phone. The camera improved a lot from my previous Sony Xperia. Takes decent pictures even in darker environments. The sound is good but for a Sony device it could improve. I would love to have more control over the sound output, but it is not bad. Battery life is great. I do not use my phone all day so i could get up to 2.5 days without charging. The graphics in the phone are excellent, I could just stare at the background just admiring how great it is. The keyboard is a great size, I have a medium size hand and have had difficulty typing on smaller phones before, with this one no issues. The price for a Sony phone is unbelievable, no great phone can be found at that price in any cellphone company. I am happy with my purchase. I am comparing this phone with a One Plus 5 and a Sony Xperia Z3 ( which I am still using as a BYOD at my job. 1;	0.4	9.2
B077ZKKBDB	5	"Great value \Yes, it is large. Well made. Beautiful and vibrant screen. Great transfer app...all data, texts, contacts, ringtones, etc came over easily from previous phone (LG G3). Fast browsing. Oreo has nifty features. extended usage with larger battery. Fingerprint unlock is terrific. Curved screen is attractive but well fitting screen protector is problematic. I can't figure the \""\""mid-level\""\"" label in the media....after previously owning iPhones and Galaxys  this XA2 is as fully functional as those costing so much more. Highly recommend.\"";"""	0.4	6.0
B077ZKKBDB	5	Testing... Got it in blue and I love love love the color. Looks better in person than in photos. I'm testing the unit. This has US Warranty (1year) so I recommend to contact Sony Customer Service and buy the extended warranty of 1 more year. I'm a Sony customer, but in the past years xperia's screens used to fail, blink, color change, not responding, crazy, etc. 1;	0.1	2.3

B077ZMWX1W	5	Great value for the price Bought this for my mom's Christmas gift since her old phone died on her. It's not the highest resolution screen but the image is sharp, it takes nice photos and has great battery life. You may not be playing a lot of games on it, but as a daily driver phone the specs keep it running smoothly and call volume is acceptable. 1;	0.6	2.4

B0787V183F	5	Great Phone, Great Price Excellent Deal. Battery life is a little on the short side, but keep a charger near and it's not too big a deal. I had none of the problems that I've seen in other reviews. Got it activated with Verizon with no problems. The only indicator that it is a refurb is a few scratches on the back and edges. No damage to the screen. Nothing a case doesn't cover. Excellent value for the money. The pixel 2 is by far the nicest phone I've owned. Love the camera and the operating system is clean and fast. Only complaint about the phone design is that there is no option for an SD card as Google expects you to back everything up on Google drive. 1;	0.4	6.3
B0787V183F	5	Every Refurbished Product is Different! I ordered my Refurbished black Pixel 2 after getting my original white one stolen. Upon reading plenty of 5 and 1 star reviews from this seller, I finally bit the bullet and took the risk in buying this one. Happy to report that it came in today in good condition! A couple scratches around both speakers on the bezels, and a bit of scuffing on the top left above the camera, but for that was to be expected from a refurbished product so I don't mind it one bit. You aren't paying this price for a phone in perfect condition. Happier still to report that it works with my existing Google Fi account! I'm still waiting on my replacement SIM card, but the virtual SIM feature is very helpful in the interim. Overall, purchasing a used phone is always a risk so if you are also on the fence about it like I was, it may need a couple tries but this phone functions exactly as it should and the risk is well worth it! 1;	0.2	3.7
B0787V183F	5	Looks and works great! Product arrived as advertised, screen looks great, only a few minor scratches on back of case. Working great so far. Upgraded from a Galaxy S5 and I love the size of this phone compared to that. A little thinner and easier to hold without sacrificing screen size. I used the SIMOLW416Q Sprint sim card. Went into the Sprint store and they were able to activate it and transfer my line in almost no time. I did try to activate online and over the phone at first, but there were issues since it was not listed in the Sprint system. 1;	0.4	5.1
B0787V183F	5	Phone was in great condition When I ordered, I wasn't sure what to expect. This was a refurbished model and I assumed it would have many minor scratches and scuff marks. What came was a nearly mint phone with a screen protector installed. Everything has worked great so far and I have no problems with it. There was a little scratch in the bottom left corner, but it's not noticeable. I recommend for people looking to get the Pixel 2 for cheap. 1;	0.1	2.6
B0787V183F	5	Great quality and price👍 Phone was in excellent condition. No lagging or inconveniences. It's like a brand new phone, I love it. And the best part is the price wasn't crazy expensive.

B0787V183F	5	Looks and acts like brand new After seeing a few of these reviews where buyers said they received a damaged phone, I was concerned. But the phone that I received was in excellent condition -- I couldn't find any marks or defects at all. It seems indistinguishable from a brand new Pixel 2, except perhaps for the lack of shrink wrap on the body. Not that it was needed, because the device was still well packaged. The package included what I would have expected: the rapid charger, the USB-C to 3.5 mm headphone dongle (but no actual headphones or earbuds), and a USB-C to USB micro B adapter that allowed me to connect it to my old phone for transferring my apps and data. During setup, I was also able to bring over the Cricket SIM card from my previous phone, and setup worked smoothly. Happy with this purchase. 1;	0.1	3.1
B0788F8DKC	5	Refurbished But Still Works Great I took a chance on this being a refurbished item. I saved some money and it works great. Everything connected right up including a wireless mouse. It is really nice to be able to use my phone like it were a laptop. Once connected to this dock, I can do pretty much anything I use my phone for including making calls, texting, emails, etc. It also makes file browsing and editing a breeze with a full sized screen, keyboard and mouse. I'd recommend this to anyone within a Galaxy phone. 1;	0.7	5.7

B078JR6L2S	5	Literally looks/feels/acts brand new Just got this yesterday, and other than a really annoying chase down of UPS cause the sender forgot to mention it needed to be signed for - im 100% happy with the device so far. Came unlocked and just put my Verizon Sim in, sd card and works like a charm so far ( I switched from LGV20, so sim was correct size). Only place i saw a tiny bit of scratch was on the fingerprint reader - but thats literally after staring and looking for it. Fingerprint scanner works better than i thought it would. S PEN is super cool, and i dont think i can ever not has stylus phone again.. Phone must have been in a case previously or like returned day it was bought, idk. Hoping it continues to work this well - would buy again :) 1;	0.4	4.4
B078JR6L2S	5	Awesome so far What a fantastic deal. The phone arrived exactly on time, and is exactly as described. Working perfectly, though I've only had it a few days. If anything goes wrong I'll update this review. Amazon has truly found the sweet spot in the phone market with these. Great price, great return policy, great (refurbished) product. I break my phones every two years, and there's no way I'm paying full price for a new phone that often. This is a great alternative. 1;	0.5	6.6

B078T2T2FL	5	Best phone I have ever owned I love it so much I love my phone it is amazing what I dont love is the price war over colors because what is the first thing you do when you get a glass phone? You put a cover on it for protection. Check this out, If you buy Diamond black it is $797.61 or midnight blue is$ 689.89 then the mocha brown is $389.00 and grey is $6.92.99 What is wrong with people paying double or triple for a color. I did some research and the black is a porsche design. but the others are all exactly the same. Ok another issue I had was I got the first phone from Maxproductsales next day 2nd day shipping. and had to send it back it was super hot when you plugged it in and you could not hear me when I talked on it, and the phone would cut in and out. So I sent it back and got the huawie p 30 lite from Purple Passion and as soon as I opened the box and picked up the phone I put it right back in and it went back to UPS in 13 minutes It was plastic and I did not like it at all so I reordered the HUAWEI mate 10 PRO and Made sure I got it from a different seller THE Tech GROUP It came with a charge and I went right to you tube and watched all the tricks and things the phone could do and I am still learning. BUT WARNING, my first phone was the Huawei mate se and I loved it so much but it fell onto the black payment and cracked so bad it is now useless. so I brought it to be fixed and it costs 350.00 to fix it and if you go to ebay or here amazon it is brand new for under 160.00. but let me tell you it is absolutely worth every penny. the only reason I did not get the same one is because I thought I was going to have this one fixed and have a spare phone and also I never ever get anything for myself I always do for someone else and this time I said it is time for me to get something nice. But it did take me two weeks to hit the pay button I can get things for others but when it comes to me I have a hard time spending the money. but this money was well spent and I would get it again. I Did. Enjoy 1;	0.0	8.3
B078T2T2FL	5	Top flagship phone less than $1,000! I upgraded from the honor 8 to the mate pro 10. I've always like Huawei phones, reliable and fast. The performance does not downgrade over time. EMUI interface isn't bad (can be changed). Camera is unreal, takes fantastic photos. Has AI built into the camera (ex: taking a picture of sunset, camera recognizes this and shows you a small picture of a sunset and adjusts for best lighting... Same goes for a person, dog, etc). I downloaded fortnite to test out the graphics and I have to say they are better than my Xbox one. No lag, great performance all around. Phone comes with headphones, headphone adapter for type c, case, built in screen protector and quick charger (phone charges to 100% in under an hour). Battery life lasts me a full day and a half before I need to charge. 1;	0.4	6.4
B078T2T2FL	5	Super quick hardware for the price This phone is a flagship performer. Very nice build quality and materials. The AI processing seems gimmicky at the moment but it's promising of what it can do in the future. like: sharp and bright screen, fast fingerprint reader, fast UI, good camera app, all day battery dislike: no 3.5 jack, no sd card, too much noise reduction in photos (waxy look) 1;	0.4	2.5
B078T2T2FL	5	The best phone I have ever used I have been in tech my entire career and I am very aware of 'how things work'. It is very intuative. The battery is fantastic. It has a great asthetic look to it. The camera is stunning. I would do everything in my power if I were Apple to keep this phone out of the US market. It is an iPhone destroyer. 1;	0.5	4.3
B078T2T2FL	5	Best phone I have ever had. This phone is the best phone I have ever had. Way better than the Galaxy s9 and works great on the metroPCS network.

B078T2T2FL	5	Had it for about a year and still don't regret it. I've dropped this phone like 200 times and not a scratch on it.

The updated don't take your memory and it comes preloaded with useful apps great for travel. I don't see myself changing my phone anytime soon. 1;	0.4	3.7
B078T2T2FL	5	Works in the US with Tracfone. I have had issues with my Samsung 6. When I had to replace it I hesitated to get another Samsung. I did not want an iphone. After reading the reviews of the Huawei Pro 20, I decided to purchase it. I called Huawei support to make sure I could transfer everything from my Samsung. The technician I spoke to encouraged me to buy the Huawei Mate 10 Pro since it had a US Warranty. I did that. Phoneclone was easy to use and in no time my phone was ready to go.I have had the phone for about a month and I am still getting used to all the camera functions but all in all, I am very pleased with the phone. 1;	0.1	1.6
B078T2T2FL	5	Minor bump but so far so good I left Samsung 5 for this new Huawei so I'm definitely still getting used to new phone features. Be mindful that when you set up multiple levels of security (pswd and fingerprint) it may confuse system and continuously LOCK you out of the phone; forcing default to manufacturer settings (this is what the phone rep said when I called for assistance). After that initial frustration it's been smooth sailing! I will alter my review should the need arise.... 1;	0.2	2.5

B078T2T2FL	5	"Bought as an upgrade to the Mate 9. Excellent phone, very good (for mobile) camera. \So I've upgraded to a Mate 10 Pro from a Mate 9 which was an upgrade from a Panasonic DMC-CM1. My holy grail: a really good phone, combined with a really good camera, with a large-ish screen that fits my large-ish hands. I have both the Mate 10 Pro and the Mate 9 in hand right now, with the intent to keep the one that I prefer. I am likely going to be keeping the Mate 10 Pro. Where It's Better than Mate 9 - Viewing angles on screen - Light evenness on screen - Performance (slightly) - Maximum camera aperture (f/1.6 vs. f/2.2—the primary reason I'm upgrading) - Built-in memory capacity (128GB vs 64GB) Where Mate 9 is Better (IMO) - Screen size (both are 6\""\"" diagonal  but the 9 is 16:9 HD;"""	0.4	2.8

B078T2T2FL	5	Best phone ever I have been using Iphone 4s, Huawei Mate 2, Honor 5X, Huawei Mate 9, Samsung S7 edge in the past. And recently purchased Huawei Mate 10 Pro US edition. I have to admit that this phone is much better than Huawei Mate 9, the camera is way better although Mate 9 also uses Leica lenses. I would say this Mate 10 pro take pictures as good as a mirrorless nikon or sony that sells for $600 or more. The aperture is as good as the prime lens 1.8f can deliver on my Nikon SLR. The other amazing thing of Huawei Mate brand is the battery life. The Samsung S7 edge I owned has 3700 mA battery and the Huawei Mate series uses 4000 mA battery. You would assume that battery life is about the same since 3700mA is almost on par with 4000mA. That is totally wrong. Huawei Mate Series 2/9/10 delivers 2 day plus battery life with 4000mA but Samsung deliver 1 day with 3700mA. It must have to do the battery management optimization done by Huawei. The final thing I would comment is that Huawei have much better signal strength than Samsung. I work on 6th floor of a building no cellular towers nearby, my Samsung S7 consistently have about 1 bar at work and 4 bars at home. But my Huawei Mate 10 pro delivers 3 bars at work and 5 bars at home. I think this is really a great phone if you want to go contract free and knows about what you want. It is sad that Huawei decided to release Mate 20 only in Europe and Asia. This might be the only Mate phone you can buy with US warranty for a short while. The alternative, $1000 phones from Samsung or Apple? I only paid $499 for this Huawei, why should I pay more. 1;	0.0	7.9
B078T2T2FL	5	This phone is my first non-apple device; serving me very well. Great price for the features! I used this phone to switch from apple to android. Not an issue, deregistered from facetime a day before I switched phones. Phone has been in use for 5 months. Camera is fantastic, reception for wifi and cell has been solid, the case that came with it has kept it from flying out of my hand, and usb-c is robust! I 3d printed a stand for the phone where the usb-c plugs in when I stow it at night, works perfectly. There are features I don’t use. I still use wired headset and the adapter that came with it workes perfectly. 1;	0.4	5.0
B078T2T2FL	5	Great phone great price. Love love love this phone! Great battery life! The technology is superior to Samsung and Apple. It comes with a screen protector already installed. I am always taking pictures and the camera quality is wonderful. I have not been disappointed. 1;	0.5	4.5
B078T2T2FL	5	Awesome battery and powerful desktop mode. I am a light user, so I haven't seen a day that battery is below 60% around midnight. Also the desktop mode is super useful to run stream app directly on TV instead of mirror the content. Some TV stream app would block content if detects mirror share or HDMI connected. However with desktop mode, it works like a champ on TV. 1;	0.3	2.8
B078T2T2FL	5	Fantastic phone This is a great phone, runs smooth and fast, awesome camera, fantastic battery life (2-3 days on a charge), and feels good in your hand.

I will not hesitate to buy my next phone from this vendor. 1;	0.2	3.9
B078YWG75M	5	Worth Considering and Recommending I bought this Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus smartphone for my mother as her Mother's Day present from me because she wanted a bigger screen at 6.2 inches and prefers the Samsung brand name. I made her dream come true when she received her smartphone in the mail and the greatest things about the smartphone she deserved are being faster, easier to read screen, and the rapid charger is standard equipment. This phone uses a specific high speed USB cable and nothing else. My mother is one lucky woman to own something that no other family members on her side have ever used. Much better buy than any new generation iPhone and worth being the best bargain out there for T-Mobile users. 1;	0.4	3.4

B07914FQ4R	5	Affordable with minimal problems I am an avid phone owner and always looking for an extra phone for games, music, etc. This phone is easily a perfect fit for someone who wants a cheaper smart phone that still has good performance. I haven't had any problems with playing games, streaming movies or music, or taking photos. The camera isn't the most high tech and won't give you razor sharp photos, but still functions and will give you better photos then any non smartphone that I know of. The only issue I have encountered is that there will often be a slow down on your WiFi connectivity while you are using Bluetooth on the phone which can be a bit of a downer for wireless headphone users, but even then for the price you pay it is a very good product 1;	0.6	4.5

B0791VS3N9	5	An amazing product! A quick bit of info. Between my wife and I we are currently using a Galaxy s8 and now this Huawei Mate se. We have been using the mate se for about 3 weeks now and feel confident in reviewing it. For starters like a lot of Americans we were not familiar with the Huawei brand when we went to purchase a new phone to replace an older model phone. We spent the better part of three days comparing various phones from a variety of makers with the phones we knew best Samsung Galaxy series. After reading many reviews both on seller sites and in tech magazines we decided that for what they were selling for on amazon ($249.99) if the Huawei Mate se was as good as we were reading we couldn't go wrong The phone we ordered was from a third party seller and they deserve some credit here after being quoted an arrival window of eight to ten days they got it to us in only four. So to bayshine store kudos to you on that one. Just out the box the phone looked good reminiscent more of iPhones then Galaxies in my opinion,either way startup and set up were a breeze. Now down to the brass tacks we have run several comparisons between this phone and our Samsung and honestly and I mean no disrespect to Samsung here this phone is almost on par with it. The few bells and whistles that this phone lacks are just that only bells and whistles. Just to point out some of our tests. Browsing the internet Playing games Listening to music Battery life Watching videos Camera Picture quality Camera Video quality Our results are surprising. In all of the categories except for camera picture/video quality the difference between them is almost moot the Samsung charges faster and has better low light picture and video capabilities. The only complaints I have about the mate se is regarding such trivial things as downloading themes and backgrounds. Stuff of that nature. We found that we were unable to send gifs over mms when using the primary texting software and we had to get the messenger app from the app store. These are all small little nuisance issues and easy to adapt to especially considering the Huawei costs almost a third of what we paid for the s8 when we got it. Now we don't feel confident to sit her and discuss the nuances of the specifications regarding this product but from a casual users perspective we could not be happier with Huawei's mate se phone. It is everything we need in a phone for an amazing price. I would and do recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase a great phone. If you find this review helpful please let us know. If you have any questions we would be happy to answer. 1;	0.4	14.2

B079C1K282	5	It's hit or miss, I suppose, and I got a hit. I suppose I'm one of the lucky ones, as I received an unblemished seemingly brand new phone. The screen was spotless, the battery tested at it's original capacity (I get around 36 hours of use out of it), and all other functions work as described. If I could be sure I'd get this quality of phone every time, I would tell everyone to order one, but it seems from other reviews that there are issues. Anyhow, at this price point, if you get a phone in good shape, it's worth every penny. It's just a fantastic phone. 1;	0.2	3.1
B079C1K282	5	Great condition Super happy with my purchase. My white 64GB 2 XL came with a minor scratch/scuff on the back but I'm using a case so I don't really care about that. Screen is in perfect condition and everything seems to work perfectly. On Android 10 I'm easily getting through my typical day with only 40-50% battery usage. My unit came in a plain white box with an off brand quick charger and cable and sim card tool. I was a little worried about buying renewed because not everyone had a great experience but I'm happy I did it and saved a ton of money. 1;	0.4	3.3
B079C1K282	5	BUY THE DAMN PHONE i.e. Just because... Honestly, the Pixel 2XL is a GREAT device. Never felt the need to write a review before but I kept reading comments to ensure I was buying a solid device; especially due to it being a renewed phone. Now, if I put this phone in anyone's hand, you would've sworn that I got the device straight from Google in 2017. My supplier was Tech Wholesale and they were great. The speed of the phone, camera and all around usability is just awesome. It's not a buy that you'd regret in 2019 if you're looking for a nice budget phone at a cost that suits the pocket as the snappy performance and great cam will not let you down. i.e. To me, the screen is a tad lackluster as it could've been better (in terms of quality). It's still really good though and no I don't see any blue tint shifts when rolling it on it's axis. I strongly recommend to buy if you're thinking about doing so. 1;	0.3	6.2
B079C1K282	5	Phone is great and works, don't expect it to be brand new. Duh. This is not a pixel review, this is a review of the seller. Phone came in a generic box, with included paperwork and a USB c charging brick that works perfectly. The phone works like a brand new pixel 2 XL strait from google. My phone's speaker grills came noticably less than 100% but the quality was not affected. Phone started up like it should and has retained its original quality since. I absolutely love pixel phones and this was a worthwhile purchase. Ultimately glad i purchased. 1;	0.2	3.6
B079C1K282	5	amazing phone It was the best phone I ever had incredible phone quality and convenient google assistant. Just wish it came with the plug you use to transfer data from your old phone I had to buy one separate. It was a great phone before I lost it when it fell off my cousins car ( I accidently left it there to get kombucha out of a bag) in California rip pixel 2 xl 7/30/19 Its also a bit big for my hands but the size is good for watching youtube and ted talks. 1;	0.2	1.2
B079C1K282	5	Received in great quality from seller, and a decent phone all around. The phone was received as advertised, did not come with the original charger however I bought one of those anticipating that anyway. nothing was wrong about the phone upon receiving it and it was in great condition also it was unlocked so I was able to use my current service provider pretty easily by inserting my SIM card. The phone itself is pretty good as well, the screen is a little too dark for my taste, and battery does go down pretty quick, however if you do pick up one of the official chargers the phone can get fully charged in under an hour which is pretty nice. Also the speakers on the phone are really great as they get pretty loud, and the cameras are pretty nice as well. 1;	0.4	3.8
B079C1K282	5	Got lucky with a good one I love the pixel 2 XL but a lot of the used/refurbished ones out there are duds. Everyone knows, or every informed consumer should know, about the burn in problem with early models. I lucked out and must've gotten a newer one. The blue shift is there with tilting but it's not bad and my screen has no burn in. The battery life is excellent. The phone I got was in near perfect cosmetic condition. I have no complaints. I don't know where this review will show up. Whether it's specific to models coming from the specific seller from whom I bought it or if it shows up in the reviews for all the pixel 2 xl's being sold. Unless the phone fails on me at some point in the return window, this one is a keeper for at least a few years. No notches for me, please and thank you. 1;	0.3	5.6
B079C1K282	5	"Seller = GREAT. Device = Buggy \the Pixel 2XL/128GB is a great device HOWEVER, Android 9 is pretty buggy. I had issues within the first 30 minutes of operation - the Phone App kept crashing. C'mon.. its a phone. (rolls eyes) Of all the phones on the market, I think it's a reasonable expectation that Android would be FULLY tested on the Google phones (yes, I know Google doesn't \""\""make\""\"" phones - they buy this one from LG) and specifically the devices that are designed to work with Google Fi. Bottom line: Uninstallation of any updates to apps that keep crashing is the best solution. BuySPRY is a trustworthy seller.\"" 1;"""	0.0	3.7
B079C1K282	5	Love Love Love Jumped out on a limb and took the risk of buying a refurbished phone. Luckily so far everything is working out fine. The phone came with very minor scratches on the screen other than that no damages. It came with the headphone usb-c adapter, usb adapter, and charger.

B079C1K282	5	Great Value After reading reviews seemed I would likely end up with a Verizon version that wouldn't allow unlocking of the bootloader...still wanted the device and made my purchase...upon receipt...phone is in near perfect condition (couple imperfections on the lower portion of the bezel to be expected with a refurbished device) everything functions as it should, and it is a Google version and I was able to go ahead and unlock the bootloader and root the device. Will buy from this seller again. Only possible complaint is the charger is not a fast charger however I anticipated that, and it is a compatible charger for a refurbished device. 1;	0.3	1.2
B079C1K282	5	Like new I bought this renewed but was very pleasantly surprised that it looks brand new. No scratches, mars, or imperfections of any kind. No problem authorizing it with TradFone. I bought this to replace a Samsung J7 and wish I had done it years ago. I luv my Pixel II ! 1;	0.3	2.4
B079C1K282	5	Great Phone After reading some reviews of this refurbished phone from this seller I was unsure if I should purchase it or not. My old phone was still usable so I figured I could always go back to it if I had to return or wait for a replacement. It's been one month since I rolled the dice with the Pixel and I'm very happy I got it. It clearly isn't brand new but there were no major scratches or damage. The screen, battery life and performance are excellent. This is the best phone I've ever owned and well worth the price. I never leave reviews for anything that I purchase but decided to make an exception. 1;	0.4	4.2
B079C1K282	5	Um WOW. Can I just say wow? After reading the reviews, I was very skeptical about buying this. It took me about 2 months to actually decide on purchasing it. And I am shocked. It came perfectly. No scratches, not a single mark on the back. The camera is beautiful. Finger print reader in tact. Everything is perfect. Even had a screen protector on it, and not even a scratch on that. I can't believe this is referbished, I am so happy with this purchase. 1;	0.1	5.0
B079C1K282	5	Best phone for the buck if you need a phone right now and are holding off for a 5G phone. If you are holding off for a 5G phone and do not want to buy a new phone this is your best option for the price. The great thing is it also has a built-in ecard for Google project Fi that will work in over 200 countries at only 20 cents a minute; not to mention it's just a great this phone and takes great pictures as well. This phone will work on all CDMA and GSM carriers in the United States as well. 1;	0.5	2.8
B079C1K282	5	Even Better than expected I noticed two small scratches on the outside edge of the phone. (Barely visible) other that that the phone seems to be in perfect condition.

B079C1K282	5	Solid device for the money Got this refurbished phone for a great price. It's in great condition, practically flawless besides a few scratches/scuffs on the back(which doesn't really matter). After about a week of of testing with Accubattery it shows the battery health at about 95% of original capacity so not bad for a used phone.

B079C1K282	5	"Pure Perfect!!! \My old phone was on life support, I needed something cheap and fast to arrive. This arrived next day, about that...the delivery person DELIVERED TO THE WRONG APARTMENT. The address wasn't even close. Luckily, I was able to identify the apartment from the photo he took and I was able to retrieve it from the doorstep, luckily no one was home....I knocked several times to inform them, that this was my package. Anyway, I LOVE THIS PHONE!!! First, if it's a renewed phone, I can't tell, the phone came in pristine condition like new, not a scratch or blemish on it. Phone came with USB-C charger, USB to USB-C adapter which made transferring my data a snap. I just plugged the cable into my old phone following the directions on the Pixel, it did the rest in less than 15 minutes. All of my apps from the Play Store installed as soon as I logged in with my gmail account. One slight snafu, I actually had two gmail addresses added to my old phone, so I had to add both accounts to retrieve all of my contacts and photos. Phone also came with USB-C to 3.5 headphone jack adapter, very nice as some reviews reported not getting hardly anything. The only thing that I did not receive was the little SIM too to insert my SIM card... a paper clip did the trick. One thing to note if you're like me, I had the same phone for close to seven years, so I had the larger SIM, if you have the larger SIM, you'll need to go to your carrier and request a new one, mine cost me $8 for the smaller one. I was told by the rep that you can cut them, found this....you're welcome: https://www.amazon.com/Aerb-Nano-Micro-Nano-Standard-Micro-Standard-Cellphones/dp/B009P16FKY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=SIM+Card+cutter&qid=1565720397&s=gateway&sr=8-3 The Pixel 2XL is outstanding and it's packed with so many cool features that I'll leave you to do your own homework but everything they say about this phone is true. Camera is awesome, the notification screen, the song identification, Google Assistance is BADASS, the squeeze to bring up GA is way awesome. You'll see people peeking at it when you use it...lol. Oh and it's FAST, for me this was a huge step up coming from an Old Samsung Note 3, which I gave a proper burial in my junk drawer, it served me well, so I may be slightly skewed. I can say however, the software truly shines and I have so much control over how things look and behave. The fingerprint reader is flawless. I added both index fingers and the reader not only unlocks the phone but integrates with other secure apps like my banking app and portal to my apartment. The phone is frequently updated, about three a week...which is awesome. Battery life is very good, I can go all day on a charge, that does not include screen on constant play time but reasonable use. I no longer have to lug around a portable battery The one pet peeve I have is, this sucker is thin!! So thin, it's difficulty to pick up from a table. It's a solid phone with a little weight to it, so I'm thinking, how long before I drop this puppy? I got a case immediately, I ordered this one because I didn't want to cover up the phone but add some protection without bulking it up too much. This was perfect flexible and doesn't add bulk or weight, just enough to hang on a little better. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0747813GV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Screen is beautiful. Probably my favorite feature is the call screen which allows you to screen calls. When someone or something calls you, you can hit \""\""Screen Call\""\"" and your phone will basically say  \""\""What do you want;"""	0.3	16.7
B079C1K282	5	Looks new, works like new, half price! The battery life is around triple that of my original Pixel XL! Amazing, sometimes I go into day 3 before I need to charge again and I am a pretty heavy phone user, web services mainly. If you stream movies, it will be less so, but still much better than an older phone. The camera seems sharper than my previous Pixel XL. The WiFi is A LOT better than the Pixel XL's, which has a huge known bug in the 2.4 GHz bands. So nice to have a phone again that does not have that bug. Also, this phone will support Android Q and maybe its successor, so it's a bit future proof. The display is also quite good. The only thing missing is a headphone jack, but I am being assimilated. Once wireless charging is everywhere, there will probably be no holes in phones at all and they will be waterproof, so that's just one step closer to that future I guess. Anyway, excellent value for this refurbished Pixel 2 XL, about half its original new price and I cannot see a scar on it, looks new, works like new. 1;	0.4	6.5
B079C1K282	5	Arrived quickly, love the camera I bought this phone from a recommendation from my daughter. I really like the speed of the processor, it doesn't lag when going from one app to another. The camera takes amazing photos. I am a little disappointed with the battery life, I have to keep it on battery saving to allow the battery to last a whole day. That may be because this is a renewed phone? I am not if the new batteries have the same issue. I really like this phone and the size of the screen. It might be too big for some people who like to keep their phone in a pocket, but for me, I rarely do that and was looking for a phone that wouldn't lag when I needed to get to an app or make a phone call quickly and this does that very well. I also wanted a phone with an excellent camera and this nails that as well. 1;	0.4	5.8
B079C1K282	5	Excellent all around phone for the Android user with an incredible camera to go with it. Pros: I absolutely like the condition of this refurbished Pixel phone(perfect condition IMO), the build quality is excellent, exceptional battery life, plenty of built-in storage (64GB) and unlimited original quality pics/vids that don't count against your Google storage. Almost forgot to mention just how amazing this phone's camera quality is and would definitely say that it's now up there with the iPhones camera. Cons: Battery life lasts 24hrs+ with moderate usage and constant sync up of all my services unlike my old LG Stylo 4 that lasted nearly 2 days on a single charge. Built quality is great looking but too slick to hold with out worry of slipping out of your hands. I'd recommend a case for sure. The screen is decent but does have a blue tint to it and the colors seem washed out. I can't really find anything deal breaking about this phone, so I can't see a downside to not owning this phone, especially if you're a heavy Google service user like myself. 1;	0.3	4.5
B079C1K282	5	A bargain and the best phone I ever had. My pixel 2xl came in perfect conditions, as good as new, not even a scratch on it!! only things missing were the original charger ( a third party was provided, it works just perfect) cable, headphones jack adapter and data transfer adapter. Which are not very important! I would recommend a case and screen protector. Reasons to get a pixel, the smartest phone out there, on point updates and the camera! Battery is excellent too, with Android pie it last almost 2 days and I use it a lot. With this camera, you will love taking pictures, plus unlimited store in Google photos as a plus. Stereo speakers are great for watching videos or listening to music. And not notch!! You won't regret it, I hope this helps!! 1;	0.4	7.4
B079C1K282	5	Works Fine for Me I was nervous about ordering this phone after reading some of the reviews but I'm happy that I bought it. I dont use the finger print reader {Professional Conspiracy Theorist} so I cant judge that feature but everything else works great. I really ordered the phone for the camera and the storage {64gb} and I am pleased. I use a different charging plug. No wear and tear, scratches, etc. I've had it for a week. Time will tell but so far so good! 1;	0.4	4.5

B079H6RLKQ	5	Not really sure why I decided to try out the Samsung Galaxy S9+ but happy that I did so far I am a die hard Apple person. All my desktop computers at home are Apple, my other 4 family members all have iPhones and we have laptops that are all Apple. Not really sure why I decided to try out the Samsung Galaxy S9+ but happy that I did so far. I was using a 4 1/2 year old iPhone 5s so I figured any phone would be a huge upgrade to the modern world. It still takes a little getting used to coming from the IOS system's way of doing things. I do lose the capability of iMessage and FaceTime. Not a huge deal and I can use the DUO app from Google which is the same as FaceTime. The key points with this phone are that the large and beautiful screen looks great. I like the haptic feel of the keys when texting how you feel the keys being pressed (a little buzz/vibration). I think the new iPhone X does this too but again, I'm coming from a 5s. My only two choices for a new phone were this S9+ or keep on with Apple and get an iPhone X. The X would have cost me $1150 plus an AppleCare warranty for $200. I got this Samsung (and got the Ultimate Play Bundle) for $840 plus $100 for the bundle. Took out a Square Trade 2 year warranty for $108 with only a $99 deductible should I need to use it. I have used Square Trade warranties in the past for other products and they have always replaced and stood by their guarantee. Square Trade is owned by Allstate so I have confidence in them. Getting back to the phone, the S9+ seems to work VERY fast when loading apps and pages. I use it for a lot of my wireless products at home (Nest thermostat, wireless cameras, LIFX lights, Liftmaster garage door opener) and all work fast and flawlessly. The audio when playing music sounds great. Plays very loud and clear for a phone. I like the fact that it does still have an earphone jack. I like the Android system as it comes with Google Assistant voice command. Most people hate the Bixby feature on this phone. My only real gripe with it is the large button on the left side of the phone and that when trying to adjust the phone volume I accidentally hit Bixby sometimes. I do like though that i's voice activated. I get in my car in the morning, speak to wake up Bixby and command it to open up whatever app I need (usually Waze). Once open, I speak to Waze to take me to work. All of this without having to look at my phones screen or take my eyes off the road. Also, the Bixby AI camera function is very cool too. There are about 8 or 9 different things it can do with the camera. Like, point the camera lens at a sign in a foreign language and have it live translate the sign to English or any other language on the phone (and there are plenty of them on this phone). Point it at food and it will tell you what it is and average calorie count. Point it at a wine bottle label and it will give you the information on the wine (type, year, etc...). The ONLY thing I think I will never use again and of course I tried it out is the Animoji of myself or any of my friends. It's scary weird. Everyone looks the same on this. I would personally like to see an update to the phone where they fix this to be more of a 3D type and look more realistic. I have been looking online for days at comparisons of the pictures taken on this phone compared to others. Mot notably the iPhone X. In my opinion, the X does do a lot of pix better. The contrast is usually better. The real advantage to this phone is it tends to overexpose a bit. So, dark scenes will look a bit brighter than on the iPhone X. The only thing I had to get used to is the colors on a Samsung phone are very oversaturated. Colors are very bright. There is a setting in display function that gives you 4 options of view. I turned it down to one of them and it now looks a LOT more realistic. I like the fact that this phone, as well as the iPhone X, features ability to record video at 4K 60fps. Looks great. On the Samsung though the optical stabilization doesn't work when shooting 4K 60fps. Keep a steady hand and this isn't an issue. For all other video formats, the stabilization on the Samsung works better than the X. All in all, I am happy I went with the Samsung. In a few months if I regret it, I can always keep it for a few months and sell it to get the new larger iPhone X Plus. UPDATE: 4/7/2018. The voice unlock code is terrible. And, after searching through the options on the phone I came to the conclusion I don't need it. I have the face unlock or the fingerprint reader on the back. I actually go to the back fingerprint scan to unlock more than the other methods as it's just quick and easy to use. Battery life has been good so far after using this phone for 3 weeks now. One thing I find annoying that I didn't know would be a problem is the video and picture quality when someone sends me a large video via texting. Whether I send them a video or they send me one, it becomes such low quality that it's almost hard to see it at all. This is because of the compression the carriers use to send these video's or large picture files so it doesn't take up much space. I was used to having an iPhone and using iMessage. Send any size video to someone else with an iPhone and it was in great quality on both sides of the text. Not so with Android. Now this is not just Samsung but all Android phones. So, for now, I have to send videos via WhatsApp or Viber (or a number of other text apps). They do compress but not horribly. Oh, and one more note. I hope Samsung corp is reading this review. The Samsung customer service reps have to be the stupidest people I have ever dealt with for a tech company. I used to think Comcast was bad until I called a couple of times and had to speak with someone at Samsung. They just repeat my question and tell me they understand how I feel offering absolutely no answers. They put you on hold to find out but come back with no resolve. Just terrible customer service. 180 degrees from dealing with someone at AppleCare when I had a question about my iPhone or iMac computer. 2nd UPDATE: I didn't realize this and this is VERY important to know before purchasing. In fact, I'm on the AT&T network with my phone and the people in the factory store didn't know this. The sales people in Best Buy in the phone department did not know this either. When you buy an unlocked Galaxy S9 or S9+, your phone is $840. If however you want to buy it thru AT&T for their network and not a factory unlocked phone, it has different options on it. Meaning, the unlocked phone WILL NOT have: WIFI calling option, HD Audio option, VVM (video voice messaging) and you will not get video voice calling. The option for these features is not even on my phone. Now, you CAN buy the AT&T phone and pay $915 up front or on a plan (either way it's $75 more than the factory unlocked phone). After you pay $75 ,more and if you are paying the full price up front, you can get the AT&T phone unlocked and then you will have these features. Nowhere at Best Buy or any AT&T store do they tell you this. In my mind, it's a great misrepresentation that is omitted when purchasing. I picked up the bundle package here on Amazon for $100 more and got a lot of cool gadgets so I'm keeping my setup. I just want others to know there is a difference when buying the unlocked version both in price and the feature set you get. I figured the AT&T version just had a bunch of their proprietary apps pre-installed. Hope this helps out someone beforehand that really wants those features. And, I went to the AT&T store figuring there was a way they could flash the options to my phone. There isn't. They cannot update your phone to get these options. 3rd UPDATE: April 15th, 2018 I discovered a great feature today. I wish these Galaxy 9 phones had the rise to wake feature which is what the iPhone X has. You pick up the phone and just look at it to unlock via your face and it's good to go. What I discovered is setting the Google Assistant to open the Galaxy EVEN FROM the locked screen via my voice and the phone unlocks and does what you ask the Google Assistant to do. Love this feature immensely. 4th UPDATE April 23, 2018 As I play around more with this phone, I am learning some cool things it can do. For instance, from the factory it come pre-set so that whether you swipe up or down the phone will go to your app tray. No need for repetition with swiping either up or down. There is a setting so that when you swipe up it opens the app tray (as it come from Samsung pre-set) but change the setting and when you swipe down from any place on the phone and you've got your phones popular settings in front of you. Even better, if you swipe down using two fingers from the top of the screen, it opens the second part of the settings which control other functions (usually this is a two part deal so this makes it one step easier). Also, one thing Samsung addressed with the 9 and 9+ (using the Oreo software) is a problem people using these phones prior used to hate. Now, you can set the up/down volume buttons to control MEDIA volume no matter what you are viewing. And, if you want to control the ringtone or another type of volume, when you push up or down on the volume and the MEDIA volume shows just tap on the down arrow on the top left of the screen and you have all the others ready to adjust exactly as you like them. Apparently from reading online this has been an annoyance of a problem for a long time with the Galaxy phones that is now solved. 1;	0.1	41.9

B079Z792J7	5	Great battery life, awesome budget phone I brought this phone in the box to a Verizon store to set up my account. Everything works perfectly on the network and Verizon accepted the phone no problem. Cons: Camera shutter speed is slow. This is not a Pixel; if you are looking for an incredible camera, this is not the phone for you. Pros: Everything else. I use my phone all day and keep it on beside me at night. I only charge it for ~45 minutes every morning and it's good to go for 24 hours. I mostly use my phone for messenger, music via Bluetooth, and reading. Depending on usage and screen brightness, sometimes my phone gets to low battery at the end of the day. But a 1 hour phone call only uses about 5% of the battery. Also, the sound is AMAZING: do yourself a favor and turn on the Equalizer feature on Spotify. The difference is huge. The mediocre camera is a really small sacrifice for this awesome deal. Performance-wise, this is at least as good as my previous Nexus. I would highly recommend this super cheap phone. 1;	0.2	7.1
B079Z792J7	5	"Great phone for the price! \I've had mine for a little over a month now. It's a great phone for the price. The absence of NFC isn't an issue for me. For a third of the price of a \""\""flagship\""\"" phone I can put up with minor lag or slowness once in awhile  it doesn't happen that often and happens on \""\""flagship\""\"" phones too. The sound is loud and good but would be better if stereo. Coming from a moto Z play droid the battery life isn't near as good but expected that and it isn't bad at all. Can still get thru a day fairly easy. As far as durability I don't know. Read it's pretty fragile and I have a Spigen Tough Armor case on but not going to test it lol.\"";"""	0.3	4.5
B079Z792J7	5	Slippery when dry This phone is great, the battery charges really quickly and lasts all day with a decent amount of usage. I would warn, you'll need a case, this is the slickest phone I've ever owned, holding it one handed? it'll slip out. Putting it on a surface with a 1degree slope? It'll slide down that. Long drawn out point, get a case because this phone is slippy! Great value for money though 1;	0.3	3.1
B079Z792J7	5	Simple You won't regret this IDK what you want or expect from a budget phone but this one works fantastic. Fast charging, plenty of battery life and not to many dumb features. Looks great feels great, throw a $15 case on it and you have a great 2-3 year phone no worries. When on its last 5% or so of battery it will slow down a bit but if you charge it every night you'd be hard pressed to get it there. Playing YouTube music for 6 hours with it's own speaker only dropped battery by 30%. Of your watching YouTube vids at full brightness will give you at least 6-8 hours or more. I prob watched 4 hours or so worth of you tube today and only have lost 40-45% batt. Great phone for the price 1;	0.3	3.8
B079Z792J7	5	Great value This was a replacement for an old phone. I didn't want to spend a huge amount of money for a highend phone, and this was a good phone at a much more reasonable price. It has more features than I need or use. I don't watch a lot of streaming of videos, so the battery lasts for 2 or 3 days. 1;	0.4	2.6
B079Z792J7	5	5 Months Later... I bought this phone for my teenage daughter in January. After five months of use by a teenager, it still works perfectly in every way! Every function of this phone still works quickly and flawlessly! Her favorite function is the camera. My daughter is very artistic. She would take photos of her art and said they turned out beautifully with very little effort on her part. I would definitely recommend this phone! In fact, I might have to get myself one:) 1;	0.6	6.2
B079Z792J7	5	Great phone I got this phone for myself to replace my Samsung Galaxy S5. I had a Motorola Droid mini before that and loved it so I thought I'd give this a try. The phone is truly unlocked. You can delete apps that are preloaded if they're not operation necessary. Phone is fast. Calls are clear and the screen colors are good. The phone is a good size for small hands. I use straight talk (Verizon) for my service, but it's compatible with all major carriers and Google Fi. 1;	0.4	4.2
B079Z792J7	5	This is an awesome phone Good phone, fast and with plenty of memory for apps if you add a SD card and put your data storage there. The 4000 mah battery provides excellent life.

B079Z792J7	5	Best value for money for Verizon customers. Bought these after being frustrated at lack of cheap mid-range phones for Verizon customers, and the death of the Nexus line had me feeling empty inside. After my wife's Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge stopped working I gave her my Moto G5+ (which she is super pleased with!) and bought myself this Moto G6 and I couldn't be happier. Battery lasts me two days, camera is adequate, can't complain about the screen, and performance is about what I'd expect for the price. There does seem to be a slight lack of signal strength vs an iPhone but that's a phone that costs 5x as much so it's hard to fault the Motorola too much. The chop-for-flashlight and twist-for-camera gestures seemed gimmicky at first but now I feel dirty inside any time I use a phone that doesn't have them and find myself using them 2 to 3 times per day. Excellent addon. The rest of Android is pretty much untouched and free of any bloatware, which is an enormous plus over even more expensive phones from Samsung, Sony, etc., much less its budget competitors from Huawei or Xiaomi. 1;	0.2	4.6
B079Z792J7	5	"Big storage capacity, fast charging \I ordered 2 of these, and had to track down a sim card from Verizon. Contrary to what the Verizon rep online advised, the \""\""local verizon vendors\""\"" wanted to charge for one. You can contact Verizon and have them mail you a free sim card. :) (Do it when you place the order). There is a slot for a HUGE memory card (125 GB)   and a slot for a 2nd sim card too. Takes great photos! This was a replacement for an old Samsung Galaxy note 3. This Moto G6 uses a USB C cable and we ordered a 3 pack elsewhere on Amazon for our vehicles and other charging devices.

B079Z792J7	5	Seemingly a good value I bought this for my wife who is not tech savvy. I have a similar model that is a year older. I was concerned about the lower resolution of the screen of the Moto 6 Play, but it is fine for my wife and I don't really see the difference either. The screen is brilliant, crisp and clear. I am also impressed with the battery life. With battery draining functions like location and Bluetooth turned off, the battery can go three days without a charge. It comes with plenty of memory so no worry about too many apps. 1;	0.3	4.4
B079Z792J7	5	Best phone for the price After doing some research I discovered this phone had better stats than comparably priced phones. I've had it for about three months and haven't had any apps crash, even with multiple apps running at the same time, and no problems with reception. It has good battery life. It typically only needs recharging at night, unless using GPS or playing games or movies for extended period of time during the day. When it does need recharging during the day it recharges FAST. Works great with Google Cardboard. 1;	0.5	3.3
B079Z792J7	5	My Wife loves it. I bought this phone to replace my wife's samsung with a cracked screen. After two months she loves it. The sim card from samsung fit right in, switching over (on verizon) was very easy. She loves the camera and says it everything is easy to use, and she gets a better connection than before. We even added a memory card and she listens to audiobooks from the library while driving. All in all, it was a very good choice for medium level smartphone. 1;	0.5	4.5
B079Z792J7	5	Why would anyone pay $1k for a phone when this phone exists? This phone will run games, movies, livestreams, navigators, basically everything you could ever want a phone for, so I have no idea why anyone would pay upwards of a thousand dollars for other models when you can get this one at a bargain price. Just order it and bring it to your service provider for a free SIM card and activation, bing bang boom you got a smartphone that will do everything you need a smartphone to do. The turbocharger is fantastic, as is the battery life, and accessories like cases and screen protectors are affordable too. 1;	0.2	1.9
B079Z792J7	5	Great Budget Phone - Worth Every Penny I have had this phone for about a week now and am quite satisfied with it. Bluetooth works well and get good mobile coverage (Cricket).

B079Z792J7	5	I like it Seems a good value, display looks good, touch screen is responsive, fingerprint scanner works well. Hard to say about battery life as yet, but with light use and mostly on wifi and a low cell signal so far, it is easily staying above 75% after 14 -15 hrs off charger. Also nice to have the USB-C connector. Haven't used the camera much so far, but the interface seems good, and seems capable; will have to give it a good test on my next hike. 1;	0.7	2.8

B079Z792J7	5	Excellent Buy I don't replace my phones often, waiting until they are about 5 years old. This was a good buy and is fast and easy to use. The only caveat is that I did have to take it to the Verizon store for the sim card replacement since the sizes were different, but it was an $11 charge and easy transaction. 1;	0.6	2.4

B07B81WJRQ	5	"Better than big dogs \I have been a loyal Samsung phone person since the S3. I have had 2 S models, 2 different Actives and 2 different Notes, the most recent the Note 8. Two things bothered me about the Samsung. First the battery life kept getting shorter and second, the Samsung Software that was all over the phone. I made the decision to go to a smaller phone and the Sony Experia XZ2 Compact was the smallest flagship I could find. This phone addressed both my Samsung complaints. First of all the battery life is far and above better than Samsung. I think this is because of the combination of the smaller screen size and fewer apps running in the background. I am a heavier user and I still only run down to 40% by the end of the day. Second is the android experience. This is much more like the Nexus phone I had a few years ago. It doesn't have Bixby or Samsung cloud and other apps running in the background. It lets you use what you want and doesn't force anything else on the user. The fact that this phone is a 5\""\"" model makes it pocket friendly but the screen is large enough to be functional. It was only a few years ago that this was the standard size before the Phablets took over. I recommend this phone and can assume that the full size version is equally as good.\"" 1;"""	0.1	4.7
B07B81WJRQ	5	Excellent phone About 1/2 years ago, I bought this phone as replacement of a lost phone because is smaller with a high resolution screen and high-end specs. It is very comfortable to hold and use with one hand with a thin hard-plastic case. The first pleasant surprise was the fast update to PIE soon after the release by google, and the onging monthly security updates of the system by Sony. It is very sturdy for outdoor use including mapping in my car (Miata), 'navigation' plotting while sailing in coastal waters with lots of salt water spray, rain and the occasional drop e.g. in a parking lot (the case cracked and had to be replaced onces). Still, the phone looks like new. The camera cannot compete with an SLR as none of cell phones can but works great for snapshots but in very low light when artifacts start to show up when cropping the image. This phone by Sony is underrated in a field dominated of ever growing, over-hyped tablet-like phones because 'consumers want them' though there is hope that this trend will reverse. Renders of Apple's upcoming 2019 lineup include a compact model overcoming the limitations of the SE and closely resembling this phone in overall appearance but a large notch rather than a similar sized black bar on the top and bottom. 1;	0.5	5.2
B07B81WJRQ	5	I like this phone I usually set out with very specific criteria for new phones (i.e. small, no bigger than 5 inches), so not very many fit the bill these days. This phone is great, has a wonderful camera, fingerprint sensor has been working without issue, phone doesn't generally run hot but occasionally does. It is quite immensely thick. Screen is nice and fingerprint/smudge resistant as much as it could be. Speakers are good as well. Battery life has been meeting expectations. Only other thing I will say is that I often put my finger on the camera when I'm trying to put it on the fingerprint sensor... 1;	0.6	4.4
B07B81WJRQ	5	Buy it :) Really comfortable to hold as it has a curve at the back. Size is super as you can carry it in your pocket. But it is quiet heavier than my former phone, z3 compact. I do not know if it is because of my excessive usage for the first excitements or not, but if you do not open the stamina mood, the battery is just for a day. However I opened evey possible energy consuming things all the day and with all functions battery takes 1 day. For tomorrow I will try it with the energy saving modes and extra precautions to see where it stands. 1;	0.3	3.6

B07B81WJRQ	5	Incredible Phone ***see end of page This is a very early review, but my first impression is that this is a top notch well thought out device. The fit of the device in my hand is absolutely perfect, the screen is crisp and clear and comes with built in tools to test all pixels. The dedicated camera button is much welcomed, and the camera is fast and pictures are magnificent indoors and out. The Snapdragon 845 is incredibly fast compared to my 600 series chipset on my last phone, there is absolutely no lag. Android Pie is available for download now (01-14-2019), as well, the Sony GUI and apps are updated to support and fully integrate into the updated Android OS. Sony has done an incredible job with both the hardware and software on this device, hats off to a job well done. I purchased the short version type C wireless charging receiver by Nillkin Magic as well as a charge plate to compensate for the lack of wireless charging. Another reviewer has confirmed that this wireless charging solution works well with this phone. In addition, I purchased a SanDisk 400GB Extreme microSD UHS-I Card, you'll need the extreme version to record in 4k (the ultra version of this card spawns errors due to insufficient sustained write speed for 4k video). I purchased multiple covers, I will update the review to confirm which ones support the wireless charging receiver. In my opinion, the Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact is the absolute best no compromise compact phone on the market today and it's a safe bet that this device will not let you down. ***See my review entitled [Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact (2018 Model) and Nillkin Magic Tag (Short Version)] for a great case and wireless charging solution. 1;	0.4	8.4
B07B81WJRQ	5	Excellent small android for Verizon I've been looking for a small android phone on Verizon for a while now. My previous phone was an HTC One Remix (similar to One mini). Most importantly for me, it's similar in size to an iphone 7 and works on Verizon. Verizon doesn't sell it but it's compatible with their network. Verizon has offered nothing but monsters and I prefer something that fits easily in my pocket. The XZ2 Compact has most of the features I want. The camera seems to take great pictures. The fingerprint sensor works very well. It's fast by comparison to my old phone, unsurprisingly. And the crapware doesn't seem to be ever present. It's also cheaper than the Google Pixel 2 as well as smaller. I understand that the Pixel is probably a slightly better phone, but this was a close second in reviews, smaller, and $150 cheaper. Now downsides: it doesn't have Qi wireless charging, which would be nice, but not a huge deal to me. Also I'm not thrilled about the lack of an earphone plug, but it does include a usb-c adapter. Lastly, the phone is surprisingly heavier and thicker than I expected in comparison to the HTC One Remix. Hopefully that is mostly battery and will contribute to good battery life. I haven't had the phone long enough to gauge battery life well. 1;	0.2	7.1
B07B81WJRQ	5	The manual transmission of phones. If you're looking at this, you are weird. You are one of the few that enjoys a small phone, but didn't want an apple. I like it. The keyboard is a tad smaller than my honor 8, but I'm back to a phone with an always on Google mic, so I don't really care. It's waterproof. Wow, what an achievement. I'm hoping this will prolong the life of the phone. Not because I plan to drop it in water, but because ambient dust and humidity can work it's way in to non sealed phones. This can be a real issue in places like Florida or Minnesota where you move from one climate extreme outside, to another inside. 400 gig sd storage. You can tell Sony made their fortune on personal music. 1;	0.0	3.6
B07B81WJRQ	5	I love xperia phones Sony is a great brand. I don't like huge phones, but I like great performance and memory. This phone works fast!, My version has 64Gb of internal memory and an expandable memory card up to 128GB. I put a 32Gb memory vard and now I have 96GB for anything I want to storage (mainly music and pictures). It has a lot of great apps and the performance Is just great. 1;	0.6	3.7
B07B81WJRQ	5	Light, fast, and affordable small phone! Switched from an iPhone SE to this phone. Was considering a Pixel 2 but still no price drop and I don't really need the exclusive features or the camera. The phone is responsive and has very little bloat ware unlike more mainstream Android phones. The phone is easy to hold and the fingerprint sensor placement isn't as bad as some reviews make it. You get used to it very quickly. And it's much more accurate than the iphone's. Only thing that I wish was improved is the weight. It's a little heavier than the SE but I'm sure I'll get used to it too. 1;	0.2	4.6

B07B82VTX5	5	I'm in love with this Sony Xperia XZ2 in Green I love how the Sony Xperia XZ2 looks! The screen is vibrant with several color options if you don't like the default settings. I really like how this phone's back curves into my hand, so comfortable to hold and use. It has a premium weighty feel to it. I have missed having a dedicated camera button to quickly launch the camera app and take photos within a few seconds. Watching videos is great, like the stereo speakers and the fact that they are long and pretty hard to accidentally cover with my fingers. Also, something hard to cover with your fingers, the camera is lower and in the middle of the phone's back than my last several phones. Now the only thing so far that I really don't like but will probably get used to over time... the fingerprint sensor on the back is just to low, but it is very fast and accurate. I waited to get the phone until the price had dropped a bit since launch and think that the current $699 price is a good price for the Sony Xperia XZ2 because most other flagship phones in the $799-850 price range have 2k displays versus the 2160x1080p 18:9 display on the XZ2. So I'm glad it has dropped to $699 already. 1;	0.4	6.0

B07BBT5MMD	5	Great value & Great Service I've only had the phone 1 week but, I can say the delivery, service and initial product impressions were all top notch. They went out of the way to ship me my phone overnight, which was important because I had been without a phone for about 2 days and I was getting Smartphone separation anxiety LOL.

B07BBT5MMD	5	Had to move from Windows Phone We finally bit the bullet and bought 2 of these to go to Android. After reading a ton of reviews, we decided on this one, a 'renewed' version from Amazon. Couldn't be happier. Since our old phones were 5+ years old, the speed difference is amazing. Even though reviews of this model were negative about battery life, I read that Samsung had fixed that problem. They have. If I don't charge my phone overnight, I still have around 60% or better for the next day. And similarly, about 30% for the third day. Never have run out of power. They are lightning fast and we've improved our productivity immensely. 1;	0.2	3.6
B07BBT5MMD	5	Arrived in like-new condition With the price of phones going up at an alarming rate, I was looking for an alternative to paying top dollar for a good replacement for my trusty but broken S7. The S9 is a solid device. And once you remove the stupifyingly annoying Samsung Bixby app, you'll love what this phone can do. Easy setup, good battery life and reception. Lots of storage and a nice size for basic web browsing. My only complaint would be the same one I had with my S7... the earphone jack is on the bottom, making it difficult to stand the thing up when plugged into an external speaker or (in my case) sending it to a PA mixer. 1;	0.6	4.7
B07BBT5MMD	5	Legit and Cheap! I am on day 2 of having my S9 and don't have anything to complain about in terms of functionality. It has a great display, there wasn't anything wrong with it, no scratches or signs of use. It showed the Verizon logo when powered up and was able to be activated very easily at the Verizon store - all it needed was a new SIM card. Came with charger which was new in packaging and came with a USB adapter. I upgraded from an S5 and am going to have to get used to the longer screen, its not terribly larger but it is noticeable. If you want to save over 300 dollars on a perfectly fine S9 I recommend buying this! 1;	0.3	4.5

B07BFCFDXG	5	The best phone purchase I've ever made!!! (This is the first review I've ever written, but I had to do it because of how much I love this phone!) The essentials – The phone arrived in a plain white box and included the phone, a plug, and a USB-C cord. It did not include headphones, but that isn’t important to me. IMPORTANT – The phone did not include the tool to access the SIM Card / Micro SD Card slot. Fortunately, I had the tool from my previous phone, which worked perfectly. I imagine a paperclip would also work too! You will need one of these in order to activate your new phone. I am a total perfectionist when it comes to my electronics and this phone arrived in absolutely MINT condition. As in, no scratches whatsoever. The phone also performed like a brand new phone – Ultra fast and very responsive. Another review mentioned this, but if I had ordered a brand new phone and I received this renewed one instead, I would never even know the difference haha Also, deactivating my old phone and activating this one was SUPER easy. You can easily do it through the Verizon website. I did it in about 5 minutes. This phone used to cost up to $1,000 over a year ago and you can get this one for only $350. That is such an insanely good bargain I can’t even wrap my mind around it. If you are considering this phone, just get it! You will thank yourself! 1;	0.2	7.9
B07BFCFDXG	5	Like new phone for half the price Like most people I was really reluctant to buy anything refurbished but I got the item a few days ago and so far I'm very happy with the phone. I can't even tell it's been refurbished. As a matter of fact I don't think the one I got was refurbished at all. The battery lasts as long as you make it. If you watch a lot of videos and play games then your battery life wont be good. The only problem I had was the part that plugs into the wall to charge battery was hot after a few minutes. But I just told the woman at Verizon and she gave me another part. All in all like new phone for half the price. It's a win win. 1;	0.0	3.6

B07C2VFMN2	5	The phone I always wanted Always wanted this phone now that I have it I love ❤️ it! The biggest complaint is no separate headphone jack other than that whatever might be wrong is overshadowed by everything else be this phone does right.Every day I find more things I can do with this phone. And I love the mods. I want the projector mod and the high end camera lens mod. Everything I want at a great price. I'm going to buy another one for my wife. Very fast and great memory storage 1;	0.5	4.2

B07C2VFMN2	5	Great Motorola phone for the price Had this phone before. Best phone for the price. The finger print scanner is in the perfect spot. The processor is great. The phone works very well and has fast processing. Also the bonus battery pack was an awesome thing to include. Works well for me and I use my phone for work. 1;	0.7	6.1
B07C2VFMN2	5	Love this phone! I like the phone, it does Band71, the extra battery is wonderful. I usually am on 100% charge all day, with only the external battery cycling -- which means I can replace that when it eventually wears out and still have full battery life on the internal battery. I really like the moto mods also - just wish there was more of them. 1;	0.4	2.7

B07C2VFMN2	5	"100% Better Then The LG G-5 It Replaced \My wife and I both had the LG G5, I replaced my LG first with a Moto X Pure and couldn't have been happier, I then purchased this Z3 Play for my wife for her Birthday and its 100% better then the LG Junk she had before, that constantly dropped calls because of the poor antenna design of the LG. Anyways she loves the Finger print feature that lets her unlock the phone with just the swipe of her thumb, Also the camera takes nice pictures, plus the free Moto Mod Power pack that's now included keeps the phone charged up for two days if she doesn't use it a lot. We have both of our phones on \""\""Total Wireless\""\"" and set up was a breeze using Totals web site  All I needed to do was sign into my account;"""	0.3	1.0
B07C2VFMN2	5	its a phone Easy set-up with the transfer app. I replaced another Motorola phone so not a big learning curve. The battery mod give me enough juice for two or more days since I am not a power user. It does not have the gorilla glass like my old one so I am a bit nervous. No problems yet, it has been six months. 1;	0.2	2.6

B07C57L57V	5	it's excellent I was concerned about buying a used and refurbished phone, but it came in an almost like new box, and looked near perfect. It works fabulously and I LOVE this phone. There is a tiny little speck of the silver painted part that looks like it came off (underside of the glass) but unless you are looking for it I barely notice it ever. It works honestly flawlessly, and I truly LOVE this phone. I bought it because I knew if there was an issue I could send it back and because they give a warranty. so i'm a happy camper. love this phone. 1;	0.4	5.5
B07C5HH17G	5	Great phone, great price I needed a new phone when my Droid Turbo finally gave out but I didn't want to spend $700 again on a phone. You really get the bang for your buck with this phone. Smooth operating quality, great screen resolution, good sound, beautiful pictures. It is thin and sleek. My step son even thought it was an iPhone at first! You cannot ask for a better phone for the price, and you literally cannot get one. I did my research and Samsung or other company phones at this price are way lower quality. Will recommend to others and buy again! 1;	0.3	4.6
B07C5HH17G	5	Great phon for price. Great phone, with great battery life no overheating,I don’t really use face recognition ,it works great for me on T-Mobile and I have not had any problems with making calls or text,it’s about the same size as an iPhone X which is a little smaller than I would like ,but it has a ton of smart features and great display (also comes with really nice wallpapers like the one I have). 1;	0.6	1.8
B07C5HH17G	5	Gorgeous phone, great price, US carrier compatibilty issues Updated - back to 5 stars The phone is gsm unlocked and thought it would work well but sadly I can't call, be called, or use data :( --> I got the issue fixed and it was because of my APN and moving to the location I registered my sim card for. I have been using it for about four months and it is great! I'm noticing it's draining a bit faster but that could be I have things running in the background. Strangely enough the front camera produces better quality than the front, might be settings related. And +1 for that headphone jack! 1;	0.2	2.2
B07C5HH17G	5	This phone is great... but you should know... I LOVED this phone. Its quick, easy to use, and the interface is incredible. Think of the layout of a pixel, the quickness of a galaxy, and a camera about as good as an iphone 7. HOWEVER this phone will not work on anything but AT&T and T-Mobile towers so dont expect great coverage everywhere. ALSO the camera uses a 4:3 ratio and most apps use a 18:9 ratio so it crops the image on snapchat and zooms it in too much for my liking. If you can deal with these issues it is a great cheap phone. 1;	0.4	4.8

It's a lot lighter compared to the iPhone 6s plus. The screen is gorgeous and the UI is very fast and smooth. The only down side is that it is a slippery phone in which if you don't have a case it can easily slip and fall out your hands, tables, bed, pocket, or chair. So in best case you should get a case to protect the back glass on the phone and a screen protector for the screen. 1;	0.5	4.5

B07C5HH17G	5	One of the best smartphones for the price. The Huawei P20 Lite ANE-LX3 is an outstanding smartphone for the price to me is one the best out there see the video on UTube. No matter what Phone you buy at any price none are perfect I bought this for my wife I've had honor Huawei's 7, the 9 and now the 10 Pro. Many people complain about the wifi being 2G only is not a problem, running on Oreo and 4 Gigs of ram makes at least 30 -40 % percent than the older 2-G models that didn't have these options and many other new advancements. As I was setting up the phone I forgot about that thinking it was about 5G being so fast and it smokes with Tmobile but not with ATT. 1;	0.3	2.9
B07C65VV3R	5	Reviews almost led me away. As far as I can tell it's as described. Came ready for at&t for one, so either it's unlocked or I got lucky based on some reviews. No damage whatsoever No chips, no scratches, dents, scuffs... nothing Camera is fully functional as far as I can see All buttons work as they should and it can do everything a new s9 plus can. So far. I will update as I use the phone, but so far as a renewed Samsung phone this is looking to be well worth the money. If it wasn't for previous purchases of renewed products on Amazon, the reviews on this product likely would have made me look elsewhere. But they are either unlucky or inaccurate. Idk which. Be your own judge. 1;	0.0	2.7
B07C65VV3R	5	Perfectly Mint Condition S9+ Refurbished - 1st time buying refurb Perfectly Mint Condition S9+ Refurbished - I was slightly hesitant to purchase a refurbished phone, but this purchase gives me confidence to prefer prefurbieshed over brand-new (considering the savings). The phone was in mint condition and the setup was as if I was the 1st owner. I don't mind that there was not the original box. The cameras on this phone are incredible. I even ended up being the de facto wedding photographer for a small reception in a less-than-ideally lit hall and the results were very impressive. I choose the phone over the Canon DSLR in that situation, due to ease of use (mind you I used to be a professional photographer). This phone rules. I don't think I'll go back to the iPhone world considering how much more advanced this phone is than a similarly priced Apple offering (refurb iPhone 7+). Highly recommended! 1;	0.4	5.7
B07C65VV3R	5	Brand new phone, very fast shipping ! Looks and feels like a brand new phone. The case looks new, it arrived surrounded in plastic covering, the finger print scanner, camera, everything was in pristine condition ! Came in a generic box, with a generic charger n charger cable.

B07C65VV3R	5	Awesome value phone Amazing price for a top-notch phone. I bought one and my dad bought one. Both had very minor cosmetic imperfections that are mostly covered by the case.

B07C65VV3R	5	So Far So Good - Pleasantly Surprised I have just upgraded to this S9+ from an S7e. The difference is day and night. The seller shipped this phone in near mint condition: I literally cannot tell it's been renewed. There are zero cosmetic scars and the software seems to work well. I am currently updating the phone which hopefully will solve my only issue: 1-2 signal bars and LTE+ internet vs my usual 4G LTE. I am an AT&T user in the USA. Making the new phone functional was just switching over the SIM card and boom I was able to use the phone. The box the phone came in came with x1 C-Type Charging Cable, x1 Metal Pin for SIM removal, x1 USB/C-Type data transfer trinket, and x1 USB wall adapter. I was weary buying a used phone because I have always gotten them new from AT&T. I am pleasantly surprised at the quality and care this company took in providing me with a new (to me) smartphone. From now on I will be recommending this particular seller to friends/family looking for a new smartphone. Lastly I just want to put this on here that the phone is completely unlocked with no ties to any mobile provider like AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, etc. The following is PROBABLY not the seller's fault but this package arrived with ZERO transit protection. Think of those plastic bags full of air or packing peanuts to protect the products from damage while in transit. For some reason Amazon decided to just ship the phone and various phone related trinkets without any transit protection. To add insult to injury I once ordered as 12 pack of microfiber cleaning cloths that came with plastic bags filled with air. You'd think they'd take extra care of a smartphone better than cleaning cloths but hey that's Amazon for you. From what I can tell the contents of the box are undamaged but it still feels like a slap in the face. 1;	0.0	7.7
B07C65VV3R	5	A great deal for an amazing phone!! Highly recommend!! I am SO pleased with this Galaxy S9+!! I shopped around for awhile and this was the best deal by far. I was a little skeptical at first, to buy it online refurbished and unlocked, but after reading the reviews and seeing all of the positive feedback, I was confident that this was the best option. I upgraded to this Galaxy S9+ from the Galaxy S6 and had no problem transferring everything over. It couldn't have been easier! The S6 lasted me 3 years and was a great phone but I was long overdue for an upgrade and I'm amazed at all of the improvements Samsung has made between the S6 and the S9+. I've had this S9+ for 2 days and so far I'm loving it! This was not only a great deal, but so convenient as well! I didn't have to drive anywhere or deal with any sales reps or wait in any lines. I simply purchased it through Amazon Prime, and in 2 short days this beauty was waiting on my doorstep. I'm also happy that I didn't have to sign another 2 year contract with T-Mobile, my carrier. It came with a brand new Samsung fast charger and brand new ear buds as well! It takes lovely high quality pictures, is super fast, and has a lot of cool features which I'm still learning to use. This is seriously a lovely phone, the Cobalt Blue is really pretty. I highly recommend buying this phone through Amazon Prime! I'm beyond satisfied with this purchase from start to finish! Thank you Amazon Prime!! 1;	0.7	14.4
B07C65VV3R	5	No issues, works perfectly Im sure most are not looking for a review on the phone but of this product as a refurbished unit, so I wont talk about how the phone as a model. The phone comes in a plain box with no retail box, which isnt an issue for me since I throw out packaging anyway. My unit had no scratches, blemishes, or marks on it and comparing it to a brand new one that I had (since returned new one since this was 200 cheaper and virtually identical) I could find no differences. I have been using it without issue on Tmobile for a few months now and would highly reccomend it to save money over a new one. 1;	0.1	2.5
B07C65VV3R	5	As promised. Can't even tell it was ever used. Well maintained. It looks brand new. All factory OEM accessories (fast charger). Comes with a OTG transfer adapter. 1;	0.2	2.7
B07C65VV3R	5	Skeptical at first, Phone is perfect! No damage what so ever which is very surprising. The battery doesn't die in one day unless you use tons of games and don't close apps. Highest purchase I ever spent on a phone, can't complain just yet. Overall I'm glad I bought it refurbished and saved some money for a nice case. 1;	0.4	3.8

B07C65XFBB	5	Like new Everything went good switching over to this phone was no problem. All features worked great. The phone looks brand new. I can't tell it's a used phone. Its fast, screen was perfect. Camera works like new. Great picture,and lots of options. Battery seems kinda worn a little. Goes low a little sooner than I thought it would. Takes about 2 weeks to get everything going good. This was my first smartphone, and easy to get use to. 1;	0.4	5.8
B07C65XFBB	5	Quality: Like Brand New I like the phone, it's great. I came from a long relationship with iPhones but this takes the cake as far as quality. The only issue you may face is the phone appearing to be locked with the previous carrier when you attempt to insert your sim card. In my case, it was Verizon wireless. I called Tech Support to as if was truly unlocked and it was. Then I called my service provider (Metro by T-mobi le) and they rocked! All they needed was my account info and IMEI. So it was all a success. I'm happy lol. 1;	0.3	4.0
B07C65XFBB	5	Feels like it's brand new I've had this phone for about a week now and coming from a 3 year old Galaxy S6 Edge it feels great. Just took my AT&T SIM card out of my old phone and into this one and it worked flawlessly. Apart from the packaging you could swear this was a brand new phone. Really quick and snappy, I haven't had any lag on this phone yet. Only nitpick is that it doesn't come with the latest Android firmware. I had to do a 500 MB update to Android Oreo followed by a 1700 MB update to upgrade to Android Pie. It was time consuming but very worth it as Android Pie makes this phone a lot better. 1;	0.5	4.7
B07C65XFBB	5	Best Phone I have ever owned The best feature about this phone is how fast it responds. No delay when you make a selection. The photos it takes are very sharp allowing extreme cropping. It was easy transferring data from my old phone to this one. I find myself using the phone more and my computer less because of the phone's speed. 1;	0.5	3.2
B07C65XFBB	5	Works good This was a Amazon refurbished phone(can't remember the technical name of the program) Works like new, no issues with it so far. Battery will make it about 2days before recharging. I don't use it for very many videos/games. Mainly work, texts, emails, banking, etc. 1;	0.1	1.5
B07C65XFBB	5	The phone is in excellent condition and works for me with straight talk I was nervous about buying this item, from all the reviews I read most of them said it was not compatible with their carrier but I took the risk and bought it anyway and I'm glad I did! The phone came in almost perfect condition, all I had to do was stick my SIM card in and it was ready to go! It works well with straight talk. 1;	0.5	2.0
B07C65XFBB	5	Great buy! Really good quality! Screen and back of phone in perfect condition! Finger scanner works perfectly. Was unlocked, hooked up to straight talk just fine.

All in all I am very satisfied with the purchase!! 1;	0.5	5.8
B07C65XFBB	5	S9 Honestly this was a great phone and it looked brant new. The only issue is original phone started working perfectly fine hence we didn’t need this one anymore.

B07C65XFBB	5	Great quality, took Verizon sim card perfectly Received the phone quickly, stuck my Verizon sim card in and it worked perfectly with no issues. The battery however is definitely not new.

B07CFYMN1S	5	Great Phone so far Got the phone yesterday 2/16/2019 , it looks brand new was a breeze to set up. Works with my cellular company Consumer Cellular. I am so happy to go back to a Samsung phone where I can press the home key to answer and not swipe. To those that ask if it will work with Verizon I think it will because on the back of the phone it says Verizon I was afraid it wasn't going to work with Consumer Cellular because they use AT&T or TMobile but it worked and is working fine.

B07CHW5KMY	5	Replacing a Moto G4 First off, I am by no means a smart phone power user. I just enjoy the convenience of the phone and its capabilities. My G4 began acting very strangely (after 2 1/2 years), so I decided to look for a replacement. I had liked the G4, so I checked out other Motos. The G6 seemed like a reasonably priced phone so I decided to go that way. After about two weeks of use, I am well pleased, and would recommend this phone to anyone like me who doesn't need the absolute latest and greatest (for 6 or 7 times the price). 1;	0.4	3.5
B07CHW5KMY	5	This is Samsung Galaxy S little brother. This is a Samsung Galaxy S 10 but for way cheaper. It plays pubg perfectly. So it runs about everything you word want. The battery I think is weaker which is nothing when it fully charged in an hour last a full work day easily. Heavy use lasts 6 hours on average but can last all day if you not on it 24/7. Also if you need it to have extra battery life you can turn on battery saver mode and save more battery. 1;	0.1	3.2

B07CHW5KMY	5	A lot of value I agree with the pros expressed by other reviewers and while I can sympathize with the reviewers with shattered cases, I have not experienced anything indicating that the phone is overly fragile and that a decent case and a reasonable amount of care wouldn't overcome (although I've only had it about 2 weeks and didn't use it until I had a good case... I bought the Yiakeng dual layer). In general the phone has many of the features and specs of a premium phone at a bargain price. 1;	0.0	1.5
B07CHW5KMY	5	A lot of phone for the money This phone is great! I've been an iPhone user ever since the iPhone 3 came out. I've wanted to try an Android for some time but just couldn't build up the courage until now. This phone is plenty fast enough for me (not a gamer). The display is crisp and very nice. The camera is not as good as the newer iPhones and samsungs, but I'm really impressed with it for the price. I've heard people complaining about the phone speaker, but I think it is much better than my previous iphones. I love the Moto gestures and use the flashlight chop and camera twist all of the time. I would buy again hands down 1;	0.5	5.6
B07CHW5KMY	5	Very happy with this phone I upgraded from the Moto G4, and this phone is beatiful. Bing a little narrower it fits more confortable in the hand, pocket. It runs very well, and the display is very bright and nice. The battery life is also very good, I get easily a day and a half out of a full charge with moderate use. I use it with 2 sim cards and works very well. 1;	0.6	4.1
B07CHWMYHP	5	A great day-to-day phone. I love this phone: standard Android, great hardware features, acceptable display. Cheap. A perfect day-to-day phone that I don't fret about. If I lost it, it would not be the end of the world. This version, dual sim, larger display, is best. 1;	0.4	4.0

B07CHWMYHP	5	Coming from a Samsung - I'm very happy with this phone I broke the screen on my j7 prime and was honestly just tired of Samsung and figured I'd try something new, BOY AM I GLAD I DID... I'm getting like into day 2 of battery life. Granted I dont surf with this phone (use my computer for that) this is what has impressed me most coming from my old phone. It charges up very fast in comparison, love the new usb design, plenty of memory in that I'll never need to add more for what I do. I don't think the camera focus is as good as other cameras i've had in phones before but at this price point that is fine as I have a great Nikon camera anyways. Call quality and everything else are just superb. Screen looks great and I really am happy it has the automatic blue filter for at night. I'm trying to think what else; all in all I would not hesitate to recommend this phone at this price point to my family and friends. I think people are out right ignorant when they go out and buy close to a $1,000 phone when this one here looks pretty much just as good and pretty much works just as good also... Finger print scanner works remarkably well.... OH, thats what it is... The speaker on this thing is GREAT!!! I've never had a cell phone I could turn all the way up, set on the counter, and jam out while I'm in the shower like I can on this one... and, that's all she wrote. Has better ringtones than the samsung phones IMO also... a nice touch 1;	0.6	9.5
B07CHWMYHP	5	this phone is fast and very useful I have used most every brand of Android smartphone and this is hands down the best mid-range phone I have ever used. The battery life is pretty good. I use it anywhere from light to moderate on any given day and usually end up with 70 to 80% battery when I go to bed. It is fluid and speedy for the cost of $250. The fingerprint scanner on the front is very accurate and quick. It gets pretty good sound and has a USB type C port. For a mid-range phone, the specs are quite nice. It has an Octa Core processor that runs at 2 GHZ speed, 64 GB internal storage, 4 GB RAM, a slightly higher than 1080P screen, a decent camera, and 2 SIM card slots along with a micro SD card slot. The only drawback, and it is minor, is that the camera housing on the back sticks out too much. You definitely need a case so it won't stick out. 1;	0.5	6.8

B07CJ7DLHL	5	Great phone at a good price I was a Windows Mobile/Phone/Mobile guy until Microsoft decided to stop supporting their mobile OS. I reluctantly switched over to an ASUS Zenphone last year. The phone worked fine, using mostly Microsoft services, and a Windows Phone skin which was more familiar to me... and still the best UI ever created. But with only 2GB RAM and 16GB memory (my SIM blocked the slot for a MicroSD), the device was really sluggish. I'm done with the $600+ smartphones. I've bought enough of those to fill a shoebox, so I went looking for an economical replacement. I liked the simplified ASUS skin on top of the Android OS vs. something from Samsung, so I was hooked on the brand. My powerful desktops are both made by ASUS. This phone offered me 4GB RAM, 64GB memory, and room for a 64GB MicroSD. Setup was simple and it has been a great experience this past month. It's as quick, or quicker than any of my $600 Windows phones. One of the knocks for this phone was that it was still running Android 7.1, with (delayed) promises from ASUS of an upgrade to Android by third quarter 2019. Well, last night ASUS had an update for me - and 15 minutes later I was running Android 9. Problem solved. For under $300, this phone is a good deal. 1;	0.3	8.6

B07CLT3BDN	5	Superb Flagship Phone Make no doubt, this is a flagship phone. Has pretty much top specs all over. Ive been using it as my main phone since late October and I have no plans to change. Im on Tmobile USA and it works pretty much great with it except no Volte and no Vowifi. I don't understand why OnePlus can get that to work but Asus can't because those are almost must-haves nowadays. But it is fast and responsive. Moreover it is relatively lightweight which I was surprised to find I very much like after using heavier phones. Even though I prefer Amoled displays I must say this is a very nice LCD. Colors to me are great. Nice sharp detailed look to everything. And it is more responsive to touch and swipes etc than any other device I own. The camera is the best Ive had on a phone. Great in low light. Doesnt overprocess like some phones do. Easy A grade for the camera. And one of the big reasons I got it was the speakers. They sound excellent. I listen to online radio lots and lots through the day. Really impressive loudness and richness for phone speakers. Another easy A grade. The software is well done with good Asus apps. Nice options. No complaints there. I'm hoping the Zenfone 6Z has Volte, Vowifi, a slightly bigger Amoled screen and all the rest it currently has. Just a fantastic seemingly underappreciate phone. 4.8 stars. Edit March 2019: Still really enjoying this phone. Although I take back that I would want a bigger screen. This screen is the perfect size. Had a chance to try out larger phones and Asus really nailed it with the screen size, screen ratio, and overall size/weight of this phone. It really is the ideal form factor. Big enough to enjoy watching vids and surfing yet still pocketable. And the weight is just amazingly light. Now if they switch to Amoled screen and get wifi calling and Volte on TMobile it would be the ideal phone. 1;	0.5	23.5
B07CLWGC3T	5	One of the best Android phones with SD845, runs well on T-Mobile Have been eyeing this phone for a while, was worried that the lack of band 66 and 71 would be an issue on T-Mobile but it's not! This phone is awesome. It has really good cameras (especially when using Google Camera), screen, and battery life. That means a lot coming from a Galaxy S9. PRO: -Very fast and is already on Android Q/10 beta -Good quality cameras -Wide angle camera -Screen is great colors are awesome -LOTS of development (ROMS, Google Camera...) -Fast fingerprint scanner -Beautiful metal and glass body -Comes with a case! MIDS: -The notch. I hate them, but this one is small and can be hidden in software (by pushing the status bar down, turning the notch pixels off) -I prefer devices that are easier to hold. This phone is just slightly bigger than I would hope for. -Fingerprint scanner location could be a little lower (maybe personal preference, my hands aren't that big) CONS: -No waterproofing -Kind of looks like an iPhone (disabling the notch in software helps) 1;	0.5	6.5
B07CLWGC3T	5	One week of using it and I like it a lot I like a lot about this phone: the screen size and the color rendering, feels good in the hand, does not feel large at all, great responsiveness with that fast CPU and the on-board RAM, fingerprint reader, face unlock work great, fairly clean OS, apps that are pre-installed are quite useful and do not seem to cause any perf impact on the overall phone responsiveness, battery life is great - with some fair of the scree for emails and reminders, use of 40-50 mins of listening for podcasts in a car over Bluetooth, sometimes connected Bluetooth headphone during the days, and a few phone calls during the day (no gaming though) it still has about 50%-60%-70% of the battery remaining by the time I get back home. The things I did not like in the beginning: the volume control is vertical, opposed to the horizontal, but placed conveniently on the right side of the phone for the right hand thumb; I'm getting used to it and it less and less bothers me now. The clock placement on the lock screen: hours:minutes layout is also vertical, I personally prefer horizontal layout, but learning to use it and it seem to be working ok now for me. So, after a little over one week of using it, it works great and feels great, and I like it a lot. 1;	0.4	2.8
B07CLWGC3T	5	THE BEST PHONE FOR THE PRICE! Switched from iPhone Xs Max! Just got mine today with Same-day delivery. Exellent phone for the price! Love Taiwan products! Really happy to save $700 bucks and give up that Apple's ecosystem!! 1;	0.4	3.8
B07CLWGC3T	5	Flagship specs at budget price I've trusted Asus motherboards and laptops for years. I bought this phone after comparing specs and prices across several different manufacturers/models. I didn't want a plastic body. I did want snappy performance and a nice display. I've only had it a few days so can't offer many details. The IPS screen is gorgeous. The Meteor Silver body is quite sexy. Snappy performance. Fingerprint reader is very responsive. Music sounds great. Nice of Asus to include TPU cover. Haven't tried the camera yet but specs look good. I'll update with any additional information. I'm very pleased with the Zenfone 5Z so far. 1;	0.4	8.2
B07CMMGLL3	5	Lo llevo usando un mes y este es mi review... Excelente producto, soy peruano, lo uso acá en Perú y me funciona estupendamente bien la batería dura mil horas, hay veces que no lo he cargado en dos días cuando no lo uso mucho, la cámara da que hablar, increíblemente mis amigos me piden que yo tome las fotos porque salen mejor, eso nunca me había pasado con equipos Huawei, y el efecto noche es muy bueno. Se los recomiendo. 1;	0.6	2.4

B07D856BVR	5	Just perfect!!! This is the best smartphone that I have bought, I had an HTC and a Samsung S4, I was hesitating between the Huawei Mate SE and this Redmi Note 5, but after watching many videos I was convinced that the Xiaomi is the best. The phone is incredibly fast, the screen shines a lot, the front camera is great, and the double rear camera is much cooler, the photos look amazing. This is not a mid-range phone, it's a smart phone that compares directly against the iPhone X, Samsung S9 and the P20. It has infrared and with it I control my tv and air conditioning, and it has the function of recording calls, you do not need an application to do it. I would buy it again, I recommend it, and I'll buy another one for my girlfriend. 1;	0.5	4.1
B07D856BVR	5	Increible En realidad este celular es uno de los mejores para no decir el mejor celular que he tenido, me encanta, tiene de todo, buena pantalla de gran tamaño, buena resolución de pantalla, increíbles colores, muy buen sonido, todas las funciones que quieres y mas, una cámara increíble, muy pero muy rápido, ademas de una batería que no tiene fin en todo el dia y todo eso por un celular por menos de 200 dolares, este Xiaomi por eso fue uno de los celulares mejor valorado por su relación calidad, precio, pues tiene todo lo que necesitas y no tienes que gastar tanto dinero, de ahora en lo adelante soy un fiel comprador de esta marca. 1;	0.4	0.9
B07D856BVR	5	My daily sidekick! Having spent 4 years with my previous smartphone, the search for its successor would be a long and calculated one. I am a very simple smartphone user, as I am not a heavy gamer nor am I a multimedia editor, though there is nothing wrong with being either. I wanted a phone that would have a generous battery life, a great screen, expandable storage, and more or less, a good camera. Being a college student however, I would need all of these features to be within my budget. Ever since I bought I last year, I use it every day and have never once regretted buying it. The fingerprint scanner is also a nice addition! Thank you for your time, and good luck with your buying process! 1;	0.5	5.0
B07D856BVR	5	Good Quality for Price Straight out of the box I popped my SIM card in and it was ready to go. I live in the U.S. and am on Cricket Mobile. It's a really good and snappy phone for the price. Camera isn't bad, battery life is great, screen gets pretty bright and has pretty good vibrancey in colors... All in all, for less than 200 dollars there is nothing really to complain about. It's a solid phone all around. I'm a pretty big fan of Xiaomi and will soon be switching to the Mi Mix 3, and my girlfriend will get this phone. I'm sure she'll love it just as much. 1;	0.4	5.3
B07D856BVR	5	Buy it you won't regret it!!!!! The phone its great for the price. Really awesome. Nothing compare to the 300 or 400 dollar phones at metro pcs. This phones runs like everything so smooth like pubg or rules of survival. I havent try fortnite but it has 3 GB of ram so its should be fine. No problems at all awesome camera also and yes you can get it to work with metro pcs. You can also expand your memory with a micro sd card 1;	0.5	5.4
B07D856BVR	5	"Amazing phone for the price. \Fast, nice screen, feels good in the hand and only $200 with loads of flagship features. The only real weakness is the camera in low light, it will have noise/grain. Other than that, the camera is absolutely superb with lighting or flash. Using it with Mint Mobile service, a truly low budget combination. Zero problems so far, 4G LTE speeds too. Make sure you get the global version with the model number ending in \""\""SH\""\"" (MODEL NAME: M1803E7SH)\"" 1;"""	0.6	4.7
B07D856BVR	5	Far surpassed my expectations I love everything about this phone. Great value for the price. Truthfully, the front facing camera isn't the best, but I'm a middle age man and I'm not really into selfies....so it doesn't bother me. However, if u'll like to spend $800-$1000 on excellent camera, then I suggest u get an IPhone or Samsung Galaxy. 1;	0.1	2.9

B07D856BVR	5	Impresión de la información por parte del vendedor incluso estuvo errada El teléfono funciona de Maravilla, compre 2 equipos uno Dorado y otro negro, el telefono dorado es modelo M1803E7SH, mientras que el negro es modelo M1803E7SG, aun cuando intente revisar las diferencias entre ellos nunca pude obtenerlas de hecho el vendedor no supo indicarme exactamente el modelo de cada equipo al momento de consultarle, no me gustó ese detalle de imprecision informátiva, al recibir ambos equipos la única diferencia que he podido observar hasta ahora es que el modelo terminado en SG trajo un cargador Europeo, con un adaptador americano de calidad muy barata, se aprecia que el adaptador es de los genéricos más sencillos, aun cuando el vendedor Cellmigo, me envió una foto del teórico adaptador y el que viene dentro de la caja es totalmente diferente al de la foto, me desagrado nuevamente la falta de precision informativa, el modelo terminado en SH trajo un cargador americano original, pero los equipos arrancaron muy bien, excelentes equipos, al tener mayor experiencia actualizaré la información. 1;	-0.4	0.9
B07D856BVR	5	Unbeatable value even with cons Great phone for anyone who needs real hardware without spending 500+ dollars. Camera is okay, isn't super impressive, but for Android it's serviceable. Battery life is fantastic, as are the specs, it's very snappy and responsive and can run just about anything you'd like it to. I really don't like MIUI and the forced bloatware, it's amazing to me that in 2018 this is a common practice. However it is easy enough to corral the MIUI apps in a folder, not accept their contract, and disable the intrusive notifcations. The phone feels solid in the hand but not having a metal unibody is a definite con, as is not having a USB type C connection. With all that said, you won't find better value for the price, at $205 it's an absolute steal, and by inlarge it works just the same as any other phone, simple set up on the mobile of just inserting the Sim card and going. Highly recommended 1;	0.3	4.0
B07D856BVR	5	By far, getting more then you paid for... For this price you are getting a 500 plus dollar phone, this phone is GREAT, everything about it and if you say well it doesn't have a type C charger or wireless capability, move along you are a lame! PS; This phone is water proof and has fast charge, both of which are not listed anywhere on the product description, screen is raised up a bit but this helps for when the phone is dropped on the corner because the glass does not break like on most phones. 1;	0.4	1.6
B07D856BVR	5	Great phone for the price I've been using this phone for over a month and I'm really happy with it. It's really fast and has pretty good battery life (required charging every other night with moderate use, now its battery lasts for about a day and a half because I really got into a game). It doesn't have fast charging but I don't feel the need for it. It works with my AT&T account without problems so far. Its speakers and display are pretty good, its camera is mediocre. It also has a pretty sleek look. Definitely very good value for the price. Edit: I forgot the mention the amazing fingerprint reader--it's really fast. 1;	0.5	6.1
B07D856BVR	5	I love it After two months of rigorous use, I can safely say this is great value for your money. I love it. Camera quality, battery life, screen resolution and all the good stuff for a fraction of the cost. I couldn't be happier with my purchase 1;	0.8	3.5

B07DD71K4D	5	Great phone at a reasonable price I've had this phone for a little over a month and so far I'm very happy with my purchase. I'm not one of those people who are constantly attached to my phone so I was looking for something reasonably priced that I could use for calling, texting and getting my email. The phone looks great and is reasonable sized. I previously was using an iPhone SE but the screen was just too small. This phone is big enough without being too big to fit comfortably in my hand. Setup was very easy. I'm a Consumer Cellular customer so I just moved the sim card over and everything worked well. The phone does tend to update itself frequently so I assume that just part of the Android One process. Since I'm not a heavy phone or data user, the battery lasts around 4 - 5 days on a charge. I generally turn the phone off at night to save on the battery. I do wish that it had fingerprint security but other than that I have no complaints. 1;	0.4	6.3
B07DD71K4D	5	Android One on a sub-200$ phone impresses. Bought for my seven year old to play games and watch streaming video. It does these these flawlessly. I haven't had a sim card in it yet, but call quality in FB Messenger and VOIP is excellent over home wifi or hotspotting from another phone. The build quality is deserving of the Nokia name. Buttons are solid, sound is good. The display belongs on a much costlier device. And Android One, so there is no bloatware, nothing clogging or malfunctioning. It is clean, quick, and really shows what can be done on an entry level device with modern technology. The only drawbacks are size and lack of aftermarket support. Case choices are slim, and in large hands, it's a bit small. But if your hands are not monstrous, or you prefer less-than-plus-sized phones, it is absolutely worth a shot. 1;	0.4	7.6
B07DD71K4D	5	Sweet phone Updates came in on regular basis. I like most everything about this phone. I added a micro 64g and the performance is great. Battery lasted all-day for me.

It even had a screen protector on it. The only issue I had with it was updating to iOS 12, which went by very quickly. After a charging session, and the update process - it has worked flawlessly after activating it with Metro PCS. My existing sim card was a match. Of course, it's only been two days right now. For what it's worth, problems usually occur right away, so I'm very pleased with the vendor and my iPhone 5s. Check this vendor out when considering an unlocked GSM phone. 1;	0.3	4.8

B07DW9XMQC	5	Good buy, got more than i realized i was getting.... Although its not the latest model, it was the top shelf when it was released, it was worth the investment and i don't have to have the latest and the greatest device, this was definitely the way to go. 1;	0.4	1.3

B07FMPVBQR	5	Really pleased with this phone. I was a little hesitant on an unfamiliar brand name but so far could not be more pleased. I was a little worried about the lack of LTE capability but that is well compensated by big RAM and really fast processor. Sleek appearance and comfortable feel make it a pleasure to use and screen is huge with outstanding picture quality. Sound quality on calls is outstanding. Android 9 is beautiful as are the updates to Google services. Printed instructions are lackiing but much can be found on the phone itself. Still I had to go to the Metro store to complete set-up. Not a big deal. 1;	0.4	4.9
B07FMPVBQR	5	Works Really Well for the Price I ordered this after several phone mishaps. My old Galaxy S7 had finally died in about December of last year, and I was shopping around for a new phone. I blew through two phones that I had bought for around this price point (in fact, I think a little more expensive) that had been really disappointing. Long story short, neither lasted much longer than a month before becoming completely unusable. I was shopping around a lot for a phone that could do the job for a low price point (as I'm sure you can imagine, going through two phones in a few months shreds your finances), and I found this. After using it everyday for the past two months or so, I can wholly recommend it. Keep in mind that it does sacrifice some bells and whistles. It does not have NFC, for example. But if that's something you can live without, then this is a great phone. It has a modern design with a clean, simple, and chic look. The camera is pretty good, and in my experience, the fingerprint sensor works really, really well. The microphone and speaker are decent quality and work well, all things considered. It doesn't really heat up unless you're really pushing it with some graphically-demanding games, as is the case for many phones. I have found that the battery life also is good. For casual use (texting semi-regularly, making some calls, some casual games and browsing the internet) it has consistently lasted a full day on a single charge for me. If I am doing more with it (playing more graphically-demanding games/ taking lots of pictures or video on top of what I mentioned before), then I might need to recharge it at some point during the mid-afternoon. It does charge pretty quickly. Couple things to note that aren't inherently negatives, but are maybe different from the mainstream phones you might be used to. - The light. It has a light that lights up for notifications and when charging (which is pretty standard) but this light is pretty bright compared to more mainstream phone lights. If you're a light-sensitive sleeper (like me) it's probably better to charge it away from your bed at night, or simply put it face-down. - The sounds. The sounds for notifications or getting a call are different and perhaps a bit more jarring. I don't really mind because I've always kept my phones on vibrate, but if you're a sound person that could take some getting used to. - The battery saver mode. The battery saver mode itself works well, but it does turn the interface where the home/back buttons are a bright, jarring red. This caught me by surprise the first time I turned it on. Luckily, the battery life is good enough where you won't need to turn on battery-saver often, but this is something to be aware of. Overall, this a good, sleek, modern phone that works well and can handle most of anything you have to throw at it, even if it is a bit quirky. 1;	0.3	15.5
B07FMPVBQR	5	For the $150ish price point, Not a bad phone On cricket service, out in the sticks, only picks up HSPA or HSPAP, which I believe the bands used in my area are not that great, but i'm on 3mbit service so whatever. Camera is really nice, yes, cigarette butts on the ground.. whatever. Straight off the phone with no processing, front and rear camera. Snappy phone, no carrier apps, truly unlocked and free from all the extra crap. Xiaomi puts a lot of bang in their product. Wifi tethering works, setup was a breeze. Overall very good phone. Just got the phone an hour ago, and if anything comes up, i'll update, but so far so good. 1;	0.2	4.8
B07FMPVBQR	5	Great budget phone For the price, this phone is outstanding. You get a very large screen with a nice cameras that takes great pictures. Stock Android really feels great on the phone and the fingerprint reader works quickly and consistently. The lack of a headphone port is a letdown but not a dealbreaker. The screen doesn't look as nice as many of the other phones on the market these days, don't expect killer speeds, and crazy feature. Nonetheless, at this price point it really does get the job done if not knock the features out of the park. 1;	0.3	3.5
B07FMPVBQR	5	Best Value Smartphone? I have been using this phone in San Diego county with T-Mobile for the last week and have had nothing but positive experiences, but I knew all of the draw backs to the device going into it.

B07FMPVBQR	5	Amazing phone! I got it mainly for pictures, but am completely amazed by it. The battery life lasts forever and the quality of picture and the screen is fabulous. It runs really well even with games that generally take longer to load. There is virtually no waiting time. There are some features that I am in love with, especially the feature that tells you what apps you never use and suggests you delete them. Occasionally the fingerprint reader needs a second try, but it is very fast and is generally quite accurate. Much better than Apple phones, which can't even read my fingerprint. Overall, great purchase! 1;	0.5	5.5
B07FMPVBQR	5	Best value for money With technology changing every 6 months in the smartphone market I stopped looking for the top phones cause I was getting broke, that's why I started looking for a great phone in the mid-tier phones and Xiaomi Mi A2 really nailed it down. If not looking for the very single best in everything, overall this phone gets the job done for not very intensive/demanding use. On top of that we get Android One program which ensures will have at least 2 big major upgrades in Android OS. Great ! 4/5 family members have it and we are all glad of it ! 1;	0.7	4.2
B07FMPVBQR	5	Awesome Phone For The Value Price! This phone is awesome for the price range. It feels good and has a quality finish which adds to the 1 of many things I like about this phone.

The AndriodONE works effiently. This phone is the best for for YOU for the price. When the next version comes out, I will be upgrading. 1;	0.6	6.6
B07FMPVBQR	5	Great camera I heard the battery was not the strength of the phone, but the other advantages were so good that I went for it.

B07FMPVBQR	5	Jack of all trades. Great phone overall. Really good with the 4 gifs of RAM.

B07FMPVBQR	5	"Android as it was meant to be!!! \This is an initial impression after a week of use. OK, I know that most people usually like an item they have just purchased. I know this review will be more useful and detailed after I've lived with the device for a month or two. However, one feature of this stands out so starkly, that I want to give anyone looking for a phone the an understanding of its benefits. Namely, this phone contains an unadulterated version of Android called \""\""Android One.\""\"" Android One is the Android O.S. as it was always meant to be. That means ABSOLUTELY ZERO \""\""CRAPWARE\""\"" that only serves to bog down your device and add APPS or \""\""features\""\"" that you would never have chosen yourself. Today's Android phones often resemble the old Packard Bell PC's that came with all kinds of \""\""special offers\""\"" designed to provide the manufacturer with additional post-sales income  often by tricking you into purchasing software or subscriptions to things for which much better stand-alone alternatives exist. Android one is just Google Android. PERIOD! There are no offers to download audio books;"""	0.0	3.0
B07FMPVBQR	5	Christmas gift got it for my wife for Christmas Like the speed and power of this phone.this is the 4gig ram-64 rom. model. easy to change everything over to it from the previous phone. works on straight talk with att sim. on 4g. the second day of operation they gave me an upgrade from 8.1 oreo to 9 pie which we like very much but are still learning how to use all the features. this phone is very fast compared to what she had and is very capable of running most games. this phone would have been considered flagship a couple of years ago.the negatives are few for me. I wish they would ferm up the on-off button or move it up above the sound buttons as it is soft touch and too easy to turn off while grabbing up the phone and answering a call. suggest using supplied case that comes with it that improves the situation but does not completely solve it. would like like to see a larger battery as this phone deserves it.my wife gets about 6 hours of heavy use out of it between charges .charger is fast.about 2 hours. overall it is a very good phone and supplier shipping was fast. 1;	0.2	4.8

B07FZHHQB8	5	Some Info Which May Save You A Headache. (Verizon) Very happy with the phone. I am writing this for Verizon customers. The phone is Unlocked, but the Verizon system does not always recognize the IMEI number. I went to the local Verizon store, and the computer would not allow the employee to start the process. I went home, contacted Amazon about the issue, and was set up with a replacement. As I did more research on if even a replacement would work, I found a link on the Verizon Support Site where you can manually enter an IMEI number and it will tell you if it is compatible. I did, and was told my phone was a perfect match. I went back to the store and passed this on to the employee. He tried two more times, both bar code and manually entering the numbers. No luck. He suggested that since the online support site said it was good, maybe dialing *611 and speaking with a tech would help. This was a good suggestion. I explained the situation, gave the tech the IMEI code, and off it went. There were several more steps, one involving the serial number of the SIM Card that would be going in the new phone, but he was able to input the phone in the system. About 25, 30 minutes later, it was all done. I hurried back to cancel the replacement phone. Very good customer service from both Amazon and Verizon. Hope this saves someone else from trying to decide, is it the phone, is it the wireless provider? 1;	0.0	5.7
B07FZHHQB8	5	"WOW - Great Phone! \First let me say I was super concerned about taking a chance on purchasing a phone this way. 1 I know it was through \""\""Best Deals Wireless\""\"" But fullfilled by Amazon. But I saw so many people saying they received used or refurb phones  even though you specifically paid for a new one. So I bit the bullet because Amazon has a great return policy. But needless to say;"""	0.4	2.6
B07FZHHQB8	5	Best of the Best There is absolutely nothing to not like about this phone, I prefer the small forehead and chin to a notch and having a headphone jack is amazing if you already have a pair of higher end headphones and don't want to buy another wireless pair. I don't really use the S pen too much besides taking down a note quickly every once in a while or a quick sketch but it is nice to have and people who are far better than me at drawing or who have to take notes on a more regular bases will love it. I will say it would be nice for there to be a built in feature to use the S pen and phone as a drawing tablet and pair it to a PC. I don't take too many pictures but the camera is good enough for me and I'm sure it will be good enough for you. Battery life is amazing I have never worried about it during the day even when watching youtube for long periods of time or listening to music while browsing etc, etc, I think the only way you would be able to run this thing out of battery is to place some of the more graphics intensive games for a pretty long time and even then I don't think you would have to worry about it too much. 1;	0.5	3.3
B07FZHHQB8	5	I love it but watch the prices! I love the phone but want to clue you in to follow the prices on Amazon for these phones, since the prices change several times a day and by a lot of money. The phone I got a week and a half ago is now listed for $115 more than last week. I'm sure it will go down again in a few days, maybe to less than what I paid. SO follow the listed price for a few days so you know when the price is good. Also note that the prices are different for different colors of the phone. SInce it will be in a case it doesn't really matter what color it is. I saved $30 by getting a blue phone over a black phone, and when the blue phone came in, it looks black anyway.I am comparing the price for a new phone sold by Amazon that's unlocked by Samsung and is new, not refurbished. 1;	0.1	2.7
B07FZHHQB8	5	Love it This phone has surpassed my expectations. Battery life is fantastic, charges very quickly, I've never noticed a single sec of processing lag. The storage is ridiculous large. Very, very good large. & the quality of the camera is out of this world, it just blows me away how it instantly adjust to the distance of whatever you're pointing the camera at. Definitely a huge upgrade from LG stylo 4. Just wish the price was so high but cheap stuff is cheap stuff. Good stuff is not. However I hear if you have the note 8 then it won't be much of an upgrade. But if you have anything else & you just happened to $500 to $800 or even $1000 laying around. Then this phone is an upgrade from what you may have 1;	0.2	5.2
B07FZHHQB8	5	It's a great phone I really love this phone. I could not get the S-Pen to pair with the phone, but the seller kindly sent me a replacement free of charge and the replacement worked. There isn't much I can say that's different from online reviews, but I've got zero regrets about buying this phone. Some of the things that it gets right are the ability to edit the SWYPE dictionary and the detailed power save options. Some of the things I wish were different are the inability to reassign the Bixby button and the inability the wake the phone by tapping on the screen. 1;	0.2	3.6
B07FZHHQB8	5	Excellent device, just look for a good deal to take advantage of I got a deal so i paid $800, cor that money it's an excellent device.

Display and sound quality are excellent, high quality design. Excellent cameras. S Pen is very usdful, new features such as screen off memoz or air commands are awesome. Battery life could be better but it's still good. My only complains are quick charge 2.0 is bad for a 2018 ddvice, i would like infrared port as in oldrr devices 1;	0.5	6.5
B07FZHHQB8	5	very satisfied with my new Galaxy note 9 There isn't anything I didn't like about my new Galaxy Note 9. The Samsung software easily copied the contents on my old Note 5 to the new Note 9. I moved the SIM into its slot and off it went. It was one of the easiest and painless phone installs I've ever had. There were some files I had to move manually but that was no problem. As with every upgrade there is always some fine tuning. Over all i am really happy with the build quality and battery performance of this phone. 1;	0.3	4.1
B07FZHHQB8	5	Did not appear to be unlocked... The Note 9 I purchased did not appear to be unlocked.

B07FZHHQB8	5	"My first real smart phone \I'm behind the times. I just got my first nice smart phone and am enjoying it. I never had the money for one before, so I have nothing to compare this with... but I decided since I now had the money to buy a nice phone, I'd get something really, really nice - and after a lot of research into iPhones and Samsung phones, I chose this beautiful Samsung Note9 and I'm very pleased with my choice. I've had no problems with it. This phone is so fast! Also, I bought a lot of memory... 512GB, which is expandable with a memory card. I got the extra memory because I'm going to be making YouTube videos with this after I start traveling... or maybe before. As soon as I can figure out how to do it. I saw a few YouTube reviews of this phone and two featured broken phones... I mean, the glass broke when they dropped it or banged it against something. So I decided from the beginning to get a good quality protective case with a screen protector, and I haven't had any trouble with breakage. It may help that I haven't dropped it or anything like that. I did accidentally bang it on the edge of my table, but it didn't break. I'm grateful because I spent a lot of money on this phone. I don't know why this phone costs so much. I thought it was excessive. I am still perplexed, even though it is an awesome phone. It cost more than my laptop computer! How can this be right? Please leave me a comment if you know why the phone is more expensive than a laptop computer. Nevertheless, I don't resent the expenditure. The phone has a large screen and works very fast. Flawlessly, so far. I initially took this phone to my local Verizon store to get it connected, but the man working there wasn't happy. He asked, rather gruffly, \""\""Where did you get that phone?\""\"" I told him I got it from Amazon! Then he said  \""\""We can't connect that;"""	0.2	11.6
B07FZHHQB8	5	"\Every bit of \""\""as advertised\""\"" performance!\"" I use it for everything that I did with my desktop pc. Previously, I had a Google nexus 6p that I used in the same way. The differences are: more speed and more memory and more battery capacity. Battery capacity is why I wanted the note 9 because I also use my phone for 3 to 5 hours listening to iheart radio with Bluetooth headphones. The note9 battery is so great that I I can use it all day without charging. Then when I plug it in at bedtime, it is always between 42% and 70% still charged. THAT is why I got this phone. Also it is nice to be able to take handwritten notes with the s-pen, without turning-on the phone. Remote picture-taking with the s-pen is an unexpectedly useful feature. Screen is great for reading books in the Kindle app. I could go on. 1;"""	0.2	5.3
B07FZHHQB8	5	Best phone ever. Love this phone. Cons: - no IR blaster - back mounted fingerprint scanner - Bixby is much worse than it was on the Note 8, it's now pretty much a little less useful that junk Pros: - Better battery life than I've ever experienced with any phone - glorious appearing screen - buttery smooth and lightening fast software without a hint of lag (I've been using this phone since August. 2018) - Samsung experience is a much more intuitive, functional, polished and advanced UI than stock Android - excellent camera - external speakers are loud and rich, especially when you turn on Adobe Atmos - phone call quality is good - charges fast - S pen and it's features (this is my biggest reason for getting the Note) 1;	0.7	2.8
B07FZHHQB8	5	Amazing phone! It's worth every cent. Absolutely amazing phone! Excellent battery plenty of memory. This phone is worth every cent with loads of features and at high quality for a fair price for what you're getting which is a, which is a lot. The blue back is beautiful. A plethora of features, that I absolutely love about this phone; too many to even state and one review. 1;	0.7	5.6
B07FZHHQB8	5	Awesome phone, typical awesome Amazon service. I am using my s pen to write this review. I love having My note phone again! Be sure to buy the phone from Amazon, not one of the cheaper options. I did, and received a new, unused, unlocked phone as described. 1;	0.3	2.6
B07FZHHQB8	5	This Note 9 is truly perfect! Absolute Powerhouse! Took me four years to upgrade from my Note 4... Zero regrets! Plenty of power, the AMOLED screen is amazing, the battery life is fantastic, and the updated S Pen is great. Throw in a 128gb microSD if you want, you probably won't need to since 512gb is a ton of space! 1;	0.3	3.2
B07FZHHQB8	5	A must have phone for the features it provides. Let me start off by saying it way better than the Note 3 I sported for years. The upgraded s pen is something I can't seem to do without on a phone. The only thing I can say I don't like is the Bixby key other than that it's a great phone. On a side note I think it's over priced but it is what it is. 1;	0.2	2.0
B07FZHHQB8	5	I love my phone I should have done this so long ago! I cannot believe I was going to pay 500 more to get this phone thru my carrier. It works perfectly and was able to put in my old sim card from my s8 with no problems! 1;	0.4	1.9

It gives step by step instructions on how to set up security features and transfering data from your old phone. My first time with a higher quality phone with so many features. I just started using it today and so far so good. 1;	0.4	3.0

B07G7JQCNX	5	First xiaomi phone and global device. Whattttt, i was first scared of some views i haved read regarding the bands here in the US and i was wrong. I get 4g everywhere i go and have half bars or full. The calls comes in and switches to 2g which is fine for me because im using band 2,4 and missing band 12 for lite which i dont care. The phone is fast and battery last me a full day with heavy use. The speaker is loud which some people lied about. Its running miui 10 aka android pie. The screen is beautiful almost like my nokia 7.1 but with better visual. Has dual band wifi which is great. The download speed is also fast. Love the feature of ambient display also found on nexus and pixel devices. Cant wait for android q for this. I live in R.I in the united states and yep i get reception here. 1;	0.2	6.4
B07G7JQCNX	5	Excellent value for great all-around phone I appreciate that this phone has Android One, so I don't have to mess with customs roms and rooting to keep it secure and up to date. Battery life is excellent, with minimal tweaking. 64GB is decent memory. Speaker is very loud, so I haven't been needing to use my portable Bluetooth speaker in the car. Camera is okay for the price, but not my favorite. Screen and brightness is good. I'm not a fan of the notch on the top, but I got used to it. Works well with Mint Mobile where I live. I get decent LTE speeds except indoors. 1;	0.3	6.0

B07G8VPHG3	5	Fast and responsive phone for low price Great phone - this is my 2nd one. The first died from being smashed by a vehicle, up until that point it was great. The battery(4000mah) lasts multiple days between charges, the best battery life I've had from any Android phone. This device comes with stock Android, which means no bundled adware or applications you cannot remove from the manufacturer. The handset is solidly built, supports 2 active SIM cards, MicroSD storage expansion, and is very responsive and fast. The screen is bright in all viewing conditions, and audio quality is superb. 1;	0.4	4.8
B07G8VPHG3	5	Great price for really good phone! I bought this back in February and wanted to wait a little while before I posted a review to see how the phone worked over time. Its been two months now and I really can't complain. Always works and works fast. I've never noticed any lag. The fingerprint sensor works well, it has more than enough memory for me and it comes already updated with the latest Android One software. Is the camera the best ever? No but its great for a phone that only costs $180! Great value! You get more then you pay for with this phone! 1;	0.4	6.3
B07G8VPHG3	5	Excellent Android One Phone For The Money! I watched a review of this phone on YouTube. I couldn't believe for the low price, all the features that came with this phone. For the price of this phone, it's loaded with features that a $500 Android phone would normally come with. The 4000ma battery last me two days. Amazing battery life. It comes with the Android one, Android 9 Pie OS. The minute I turned the phone on I got the latest update. It's a stock Android phone, but that's what I like about it. I don't need all the fancy bells and whistles that the high-end phones come with. And I'm sick of paying the high prices for phones that are outdated in a few years!. So it's nice to purchase a phone under $200, that has the processing speed, RAM and storage this phone has. Had this phone about 3 weeks and I'm very impressed. Feels and operates like a high-end phone. Very quick and responsive. 625 Qualcore Snapdragon processor. The only issue I may have with the phone, and it's a minor one to me, is the speaker. The speaker is very loud if you turned it up and extremely clear, so you can hear everything that's being said. But the quality of the speaker could be better for some people I'm sure. I do listen to a lot of music with the speaker, but when I plug the headphones in, a whole different story. Even has a built-in app to adjust the headphone features to great stereo sound. The Dual Camera's take great pictures! Xiaomi A2 Lite is sold all over China, India, and Asia, so that show's a demand for this phone. I read the owner of the MI company that makes the Xiaomi A2 Lite, wanted to make an affordable Android phone with high end features for everyone! He did! 1;	0.3	10.7
B07G8VPHG3	5	Great phone for a great price! I really love this phone. I was looking for a 64G phone that wouldn't break my bank but Metro PCS didn't have anything affordable. I'm not a tech savvy girl but I know what I like in a phone. This has the storage I need, a decent camera (with the portrait and depth effect features that the iPhone has), and transferring my information from my old phone to my new was a breeze. So far, no issues. Be aware that if you are a Metro PCS customer you will need to call their customer service to have this phone added to your account. You can't do it from the website. Overall, highly recommend. 1;	0.4	6.4
B07GCBWWPL	5	It's legit! I was a little skeptical that buying a phone off of Amazon from a non-manufacturer would be a scam, but I was also desperate for a new model after my 6 year old phone wouldn't hold a charge nor work during my frequent overseas travel. Luckily, I'm happy to say that this phone is legitimately awesome with an excellent battery life, beautiful finish, fast processor, and unique features (the dual SIM is perfect for traveling). It's a MAJOR upgrade for someone like me who had an old phone and wants full control over connectivity in a host country when traveling, and better options when deciding on a service provider so my phone bill doesn't increase. 1;	0.1	2.2
B07GCBWWPL	5	Great phone This is my experience. It is just a perfect phone for me. Battery life is crazy. I wake up, go workout, watch YouTube, use GPS everywhere I go, go to work, use internet, play music and at the end of the day it is still alive. My old phone would have last like 3 hours. I don't worry about my phone dying during the day. I don't have to carry extra things like charger or batteries. Came with all the accessories including AKG headphone, clear phone case, fast charger type c, etc... I got my phone a little early. Brand new inside the original box. This phone has a lot of features. I can't even find all. The phone doesn't get hot easily like my old phone. 1;	0.3	5.6
B07GCBWWPL	5	Great phone for the price. Has all you need in a smartphone and more. Excellent phone. I've had it for a month and a few weeks now, and no problems so far. Battery life is great, along with the S-pen and all the other features it offers. Overall it's a great phone you'll be happy with. Bought mine from the sellers over at Wireless Place. Delivery was fast and on time; packaging of my item was also well put together. I've bought phones from them in the past that lasted me a really long time. I'd recommend buying from them if it's an available option. 1;	0.5	6.3
B07GCBWWPL	5	Best ever It was in Arabic when I got it and for some reason Samsung pay is still in it but apart from that I have no complaints great phone and even with the s10 comeing out I have played with one and it's more or less the same thing. Save your money and get a note 9 1;	0.3	1.2

With the pen, and the edges being curved glass, on this model, selecting items near the corners is lame, and takes more then one try, typically.

B07GS272K7	5	Great Overall Phone targeted at Gamers. Upgrading from a Samsung S8+ and the difference in performance is noticeable. Ran Antutu benchmark on this ROG phone, the S8+ and my work issued Pixel 2xl (all non rooted on stock software and settings). The ROG phone came in at 26565 (defeated 95% of all devices), Pixel 2xl at 21122, and S8+ at 19956. Before people say it's worthless comparing against my older phones, Yes I know the other two phones are last year's models (and I don't have any of the current year model phones), but it should help those looking to upgrade. Gaming on this phone (PUBG) is vastly superior - the Game Center let's you set profiles for each game and has a nifty overlay that gives you real time status of temps of the phone. Air triggers are a great idea and work pretty well in my use. The phone does get pretty warm (but not unbearable) during gaming sessions. The detachable fan that come with the phone doesn't really seem to cool the internal CPU/gpu, but it does help to keep the backside of the phone and your hands cool when gaming. With that said, in terms of daily use (outside of gaming) there's not much noticeable difference against phones that have come out since 2016-2017. I love this phone, but at it's price, it's definitely targeted at gamers willing to pay a premium. Still, for those that don't game regularly on their phone but want a blazing fast phone with cool gamer aesthetics should definitely get this phone. Note: this is a dual SIM phone and it works fine with my personal ATT micro sim, but it doesn't seem to work with my work Verizon micro sim. Also works ok with my buddy's TMobile micro sim. Just a heads-up for those on Verizon looking at this phone. 1;	0.3	7.5
B07GS272K7	5	"A Beautiful Gaming Phone \I was excited and afraid to get this phone. It's so expensive, but has incredible specs going for it. It did not disappoint me at all. It's beautiful and light, the OLED screen is amazing, it ships with nearly zero bloatware, and it takes all the use and abuse I have been giving it for over half a year now. I play games and watch videos constantly on this phone. The speakers are wonderful and powerful yet crisp, and they have an \""\""outdoor mode\""\"" which massively increases volume at the cost of the \""\""smoothness\""\"" the speakers generally give. The most important thing? Get a case. I went 3 months without one... Only had a tempered glass screen protector  and managed to dent the sides and crack the backing of the phone.

B07GYYT1LK	5	Better than expected... I've had this phone for about two weeks and am very happy with it. I arrived in better condition than I had expected - no noticeable scars anywhere. Operationally, it has been doing great and the battery life is amazing compared to a couple of phones I've had in the past. On normal use , it will last about 2 days before needing a charge. 1 day if I go heavy on watching videos or listening to music. Thanks Edge Cellular - Will definitely come back to you for my next phone purchase. 1;	0.5	4.5
B07GYYT1LK	5	Worked great - great condition. Best phone ever! This is exactly what I was hoping for. I durable phone that was 'lightly used', and showed zero sign of use.

B07H41NB46	5	Best $300 phone out there today! I just bought this phone as a backup for my OnePlus 6T and wasn't really expecting much from it. But to my surprise, I'm really impressed with how this phone performs. It's very fast, the camera is really good (for a $300 phone), the battery lasts me the whole day, is has the latest version of Android (Android Pie), and it has a headphone jack and a micro sd slot!! Some of the things I didn't like were the stock launcher and the apps that came pre-installed on the phone. I had to download a third-party app to make my experience better, which is normally what I do with Android phones anyway, and had to manually disable/uninstall whatever pre-installed apps I didn't find useful. Another concern I had with the phone was the bands it had for LTE connectivity. I read online that it would really be hard to get LTE here in the US because it doesn't support the LTE bands that the USA uses. I am on AT&T, and I'm very glad to let you guys know that I get 4G with no problems! I live in Southern CA, so I can't really speak for other people from other states, but so far, I'm really loving this phone. :) 1;	0.2	6.7
B07H41NB46	5	Surprised I got tired of spending nearly $1,000 on a phone that would last 2 to 3 years so I looked at this and a few others from China. I was pleasantly surprised within a few minutes. Fast, reliable and smart. It would be difficult for me to go back to paying large amounts of money for something I could get for 1/3 the price that is just as good in some areas (ie call quality, processing speed, durability) and better in others (ie camera, battery life, design). The only issue I've found is the standard messaging app doesn't support group texts. I downloaded a second messaging app and it works fine. 1;	0.4	4.0
B07H41NB46	5	Great phone great price I can't believe this phone is this price that it is! Just plain awesome. I live in Central California (in the cuts) and I'm on the At&t network. It works great, watch out iPhone and Samsung *This phone definitely has LTE, I think it doesn't on T-Mobile, but Att yes, also cricket which uses Att towers* like I said I live out in the country and have no problems getting a signal, so unless you're on T-Mobile don't listen to the people saying there is no 4G or LTE in the states. They probably work for apple or samsung 😂 1;	0.5	3.0
B07H41NB46	5	Fast Phone, great value I ordered this phone for my kids for use with TMobile Service. I used the BYOD SIMM card for ATT and it works great. Fast 3G speeds and good coverage so far. Phone seems fast, has a good feel to is, and the screen seems decent. I am an iPhone user and I value ease of use over features. I though the MIUI interface was easy to use and looks great. If this phone had 4G/LTE compatibility in the US I would consider getting one for myself. 1;	0.6	5.4
B07H41NB46	5	This phone is incrediblely fast! Just changed from my Samsung S5 to the Pocophone F1. This phone is amazing. I play games for an hour and it only gets warm a little bit. If it was my old phone, it would get incredibly hot to the point of uncomfortable. The battery life is amazing, too. I only need to charge my phone once per day. I was a little bit disappointed that the face recognition feature only available in the Indian version. I also hate the fact that you had to buy a U.S adapter separately for the charger. I would have rated this product 4.5 if possible. Otherwise, everything works well so far. 1;	0.2	5.8

B07H41NB46	5	Best Bang for your buck Note 9, New iPhone, galaxy s9? What are those again. Oh yea phone that cost like $1000 and this phone has all they offer. Like no battery for a phone means u can't use it so even the best phone ever built if it does on you quickly is no use to u at all and this phone lasts me all day even tho I use it heavily. Did I mention the new Snapdragon 845 that this premium phones have is in this phone. Throwing My top games and this chip barely flinches. At this price like what else do u even need from a phone? Screen looks Crispy clear. Only Test I need to do is Signal Wize but that can't be fair since carriers are inconsistent with signal so I'll leave that to experts to rate. Anyways why wasn't so much money on a phone that's only going to last u like 2 years top. People have not realized that Battery lifespan is on average tops 2years. All phones cannot have the battery replaced by the user unless you have super phone powers and know what you are doing. So in two years you need a new phone so why pay 3 times what u already have. Until phones can have their batteries swapped by user don't care how long a phone is going to last since all phone now have a ticking time limit based on the battery. Quick math 1000$ at 2 years phones drop to about 450$ take in the insurance you are paying for an additional 360$ plus the deductible for having your phone serviced for a new battery u are left at this price point of the phone worth 350 or less.

B07HD2X91Q	5	Great phone, especially for the price. This phone is a gem for the price. I had a Nexus 5X before, and this phone is a much higher quality version of that. First, it almost fit perfectly in the cases I had for the 5X, except for the buttons on on the side, which are opposite (Nokia style). But while I was waiting for my new case to arrive, it was sufficient for a couple of days. And for running, I still use my old 5X running cases. Otherwise, if you had a 5X, you will feel very comfortable with this phone. The rear fingerprint scanner is in the same place, the size is the same. But that's where the similarities end. The Nokia has a fantastically large screen that is very crisp. Old games may have trouble with the larger screen, as they get expanded a little. Once I upgraded to Android Pie, the battery life blows away the 5X. With normal use, the battery can last me a day and a half. With battery saver on, it can last 2 days. I attribute this to the battery AI in pie, but it's a great, unexpected perk since the battery reviews have only been average. The phone is a little heavier than the 5X, but that's only because it's much sturdier. And it looks so nice, I only had to get a clear case. Really, the only complaint I have is the speakers that are below average on the phone. But since I use my bluetooth headset or my external bluetooth speakers to play music, it's not an issue at all. I can go on and on (the camera is solid with some really cool features, the processor is really fast for everything I do since I don't do 3D gaming), but it was such a good phone, I also bought one for my wife and she loves it. Overall, it has flagship features on things I care about, without the flagship price. 1;	0.4	11.1
B07HD2X91Q	5	Love my Nokia So far very happy with my new Nokia phone. I have had it for a few weeks now. My first Android. I couldn't see spending a lot of money for an iPhone so I thought I would give it a try. I like the fact that AndroidOne was used so that Google updates will come faster including security updates. The new os (pie) made it a bit better as well. I have the 64gb model and added external SSD but haven't really needed that yet. The only minor downside is the very slippery case but that can easily be fixed with a protective case and I haven't bothered to get one yet. 1;	0.4	4.4
B07HD2X91Q	5	A great affordable phone As in many reviews, Nokia 7.1 is one of the best choices for people who want an affordable phone running on the latest native Android OS with many latest technical features such as fingerprint identification and dual-sim capabilities. I am a T-mobile user and have used this phone for two months, which would be not enough to review its battery life or any other durability issues. Anyway, I have been very satisfied. The phone works fine at T-mobile LTE bands, and also would have a good band coverage for international trips. I have traveled to some East Asian and Europian countries where popular LTE bands are slightly different from US. The phone covers some of the major 3G or LTE bands in both regions, and I could use them without any problem for Roming or local prepaid SIM cards, although you MUST check bands by yourself for your travel(s). Dual SIM capabilities and many up-to-date features associated with the latest native Andoroid has been really helpful in both daily life and business as well as during international travels. (Jan 4 2018 update) I originally wrote that the T-mobile Wifi Calling did not work for this phone, but this is my misunderstanding and it is working without any problem right now. It seems that it sometimes needs a reboot of the phone to use the Wifi Calling when the primary sim for calling is switched and back. 1;	0.3	5.7
B07HD2X91Q	5	Happy-go-lucky! I bought the Nokia 7 Plus, originally last year. Loved it since. Until I was shattered the screen. Amazing its reputation still hold as indestructible. I've dropped that so many times. Even when shattered the phone continued to work beautifully. Got the 7.1 to replace it. Amazing battery life. A whole day worth of battery. It wonderful and perfect like the 7 Plus. One issue. It may be mine only, but the charge is a bit slow. It was fast the first few times then its slow...But once fully charged, great battery life! Price is amazing! It definitely shops Samsung and Apple at knees. I'd love to see what Nokia offers when its at the same price as those two giants. 1;	0.4	10.3
B07HD2X91Q	5	Good phone for the price Very nice phone. Not too many apps pre installed (a plus for me) allows you to install apps you really want to use. I have TMobile and it shows 4G+ it does not say LTE but after reading a little bit in Europe 4G+is the equivalent of LTE. St this point cannot confirm big TMobile be support LTE but I can assure you 4G+ is darn fast (downloading n browsing ) if you have this phone in the US. 1;	0.0	2.3
B07HD2X91Q	5	Best midrange Android out ther It has an HDR screen, which ironically, will make all your pictures look better on the phone than when you export them. Nice bright screen, has a notch, films in 4k 30fps, USB C fast charging. Best part... Android One. That means you are second in line behind Pixels for updates. 1;	0.4	2.8

B07HD2X91Q	5	Nokia's Android One makes maximum use of memory I bought this after reading countless reviews of 'mid-range' phones. Because my otherwise wonderful Galaxy had run out of capability with its uncompetitive 3/16 memory I decided to bet on this one. Having once owned a Nokia clamshell and a Nokia Windows phone I expected something pretty good and I think I got it with the 7.1. For brevity I'll say that the camera is excellent and the variable focus 'Bokeh' setting is a plus. I have no need to lug a digital camera around anymore. The phone dimensions give it a comfortable feel in the hand and more of a sense of holding a traditional phone. The great advantage to me lies in its being Android One and therefore not burdened with manufacturer vanity apps which take up space and cannot be deleted (my Samsung was one of these). That means that with its 4GB/64GB memory you have plenty of headroom to personalize the phone the way you like. There is a second SIM slot which doubles as SD storage if you really need it. I've used the phone intensively in the last couple of weeks while paying attention to what other reviewers have described as weaknesses. The first was the statement that volume is weak especially when on loud speaker. This is not true for me, the maximum volume shakes my eardrums. The second complaint had to do with a vague stutter, or hesitation that occurs when responding to a command. I have seen this- sometimes on swiping and sometimes from a key command, to the extent that I wonder if my tap failed and I try again. This behavior is rare, the phone in fact has not stopped working, and it's not serious enough for me to really complain about it. I have no idea what causes it. A note about apps- a few apps for basic operation are preinstalled and after that you rely on the Play store. The included Google file manager did not allow for file/folder shortcuts to desktop and for me that's important. The only third party app I know that still works for this with Android 9 is ES File Explorer. I should add that the phone came with Oreo and updated to Pie as soon as I stuck a SIM chip in it. It also carries a one year warranty, though not for accident. Finally one minor gripe- the Nokia manual is a real dud. I'm very happy with my purchase at the price and because I'm not a flagship phone buyer I'm inclined to think that overall this is about the best bargain currently available. 1;	0.1	10.7
B07HD2X91Q	5	Great It is a good looking device, easy to set up and with a pure Android software. The screen has a good resolution, both cameras work pretty well, the sound is fine for my personal taste, all apps are running as expected, the battery last up to two full days with moderate usage, and so far, I had not experienced any negative issue. Overall, it is great device, 1;	0.9	2.8
B07HD2X91Q	5	Very happy with this phone I bought this to replace a Blu model with a cracked screen. Very happy with it. It updated to Android Pie out of the box and has great battery life.

B07HH9ZD4Y	5	You will be billed for customs even though it's in the shipping cost. Perfect. Works out cheaper to get it from Amazon than to get it in South Africa directly. Extremely happy with the purchase. Got one for both my boyfriend and I . Thank you 1;	0.5	2.6

B07HK4JNV1	5	The battery never dies! I was nervous about buying this phone since I'd never heard of the brand but I couldn't pass it up. Those specs at such a low price? Count me in! I'm super glad I took the chance too. This is one of the best phones I've ever had (and I come from a long line of Samsung and Asus phones!), hands down. The camera is incredible, the battery just lasts forever, and it runs really fast. I get great service too. (Cricket in Colorado.) It's nice and big but manages to still be very lightweight as well. Seriously, take the chance, you won't be disappointed! 1;	0.3	5.2
B07HK4JNV1	5	Great Looking A really nice phone,I like everything about this phone except the battery life,never do I get more than 9 hours before I need to recharge and I am not a heavy user.Seitchibg apps is almost instant.I use Red Pockets AT&T sim and it works great.I tried a T-MOBILE sim in the second sim but the data did not work,the voice and text worked well.Everything worked to near perfection with the Red Pocket AT&T sim .All and all I like the phone and highly recommend it . 1;	0.4	0.9
B07HK4JNV1	5	Amazing phone! I've had this phone for about a month now. I had a Galaxy S7 and this phone is a huge upgrade. The cameras are great. The screen is beautiful and huge and it's been fast enough for anything I can throw at it. I play pubg at the highest settings at 40fps and other games all at the highest at 50-60fps. I'm shocked with how amazing this phone is for this price. MIUI is pretty good and the themes are clean. 1;	0.5	5.1
B07HK4JNV1	5	A great product at this price I bought the phone for my dad who doesn't need fancy features only available on flagship phones. Apps open fast and run smoothly. 64GB / 4GB RAM is enough for regular usage and can use google photo to release local memory space. The only thing I am not quit satisfied is battery life. it doesn't last long enough, even if we don't use it, it still drops faster than other phones. Overall I am satisfied with the product given that is only costs $175, only 1/4 to 1/3 of that of flagship phones. 1;	0.4	3.7
B07HK4JNV1	5	Great phone for a budget/performance ratio. Great phone for the money, powerful enough to do pubg mobile on the highest settings for under $200 and tons of battery life, headphone jack and one of the best cameras I've used outside of offerings from Google and Samsung. Only little issue is if you're buying this for the states you may find alot of towers in your area (rural for me) may not support lte. I go to the city 4g for days but that's not a big issue for me. 1;	0.4	2.6
B07HK4JNV1	5	A perfect phone, better than apple or Samsung This phone is excellent all around on everything, long lasting battery, excellent screen size and real clear too. Just as good or better than a Samsung for a quarter of the price. Would definitely recommend to anyone. 1;	0.6	2.4
B07HK4JNV1	5	No regrets What can i say . Xaiomi has a very special place in my heart. Great great battery life. My third xiaomi phone. And do own mi box. I love my phone 1;	0.5	3.6
B07HK4JNV1	5	Good phone 👍 I love this product, I bought it for my 14 yr-old boy and he loves it. The battery is ok, but the screen quality and finger print is the best part of the phone. I do wish the screen covered the whole screen, but overall, happy with spending my 💰 on this product. 😀 1;	0.6	2.4

B07HK4JNV1	5	Excellent battery Nice phone. Everything came in good condition. I have no problems with this device Has a great battery and everything but don't expect to much of the camera I mean is good for the price I'm paying but not enough for the quality I like. That's the only bad point at least for me. 1;	0.5	2.8
